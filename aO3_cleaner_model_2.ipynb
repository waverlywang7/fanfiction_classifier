       "'I opened my eyes and stared at a white ceiling. Blurry vision. Trouble focusing. Beeping in the background. Equipment everywhere.  \"She\\'s reacting to outside stimuli. Showing an awareness of her surroundings. Oh my god, Miranda. I think she\\'s waking up.\" Someone said in the background.  A woman walked over to me. She had mid-length black hair, pale blue eyes and was wearing a skin-tight white bodysuit with black detailing on it. She was beautiful. Was this Miranda? A beeping noise became more frantic in the background.  \"Damn it, Wilson. She\\'s not ready yet! Give her the sedative!\" Miranda chastised.  A thick Australian accent. She was in charge. What was going on here? I reached towards Miranda. Begging her to tell me what was going on. She leaned in close to me. Everything was so blurry. Like talking under water.  \"Shepard don\\'t try to move. Just lie still. Try to stay calm.\" She said to me and laid my hand down next to my body.  \"Heart rate still climbing. Brain activity is off the charts. Stats pushing into the red zone. It\\'s not working!\" Wilson said in a panic.  Beeping came from me, huh? Where the hell was I? Med-bay? Alliance? What wasn\\'t working? Miranda gave Wilson a deadly stare as she walked over to the monitors.  \"Another dose. Now!\" She commanded.  I felt the comforting hands of sleep reach out and grasp me. The beeping became calmer and more even. My eyes were heavy, and I felt more and more groggy.  \"Heart rate dropping. Stats falling back into normal range. That was too close. We almost lost her.\" Wilson said sounding relieved.  Miranda had walked over to me again and gave me a look I couldn\\'t understand through the blur. \"I told you your estimates were off. Run the numbers again.\"  My eyes drifted from her to the ceiling again as everything went black once more.  \"Wake up, Commander! Shepard, do you hear me?\"  I woke to a combination of a woman\\'s voice and a rough shake that shook whatever I was lying on.  \"Get out of that bed now - this facility is under attack.\" She continued.  I opened my eyes. I was still in the same room I\\'d woken up in before. Same white ceiling. No beeping this time and no blur in my vision. As I tried to sit up, a sharp pain rang in the right side of my abdomen. I winced and grabbed the spot that hurt as I sat up.  \"Shepard. Your scares aren\\'t healed, but I need you to get moving. This facility is under attack.\" The woman said as I finally sat up completely in the apparent table I had been lying on.  This woman had a thick Australian accent. This had to be the same woman from before. Fuck, what was her name again? An M-name... Miranda, was it? There was also a man in the room from before. W-something... Wilson? Where was he?  I glanced down at my own body. Hospital gown, one of those paper-thin ones. Nothing underneath, huh? Closed back, at least? Yes. Good. My hair caught my attention as I looked down. It almost went to my breasts and it only did so at the left side.  But I had shoulder length hair. Not long hair.  Then my arms caught my attention as I reached for my hair and they started to shake at what I saw. They had scars on them. So did my chest. My legs, too. Scars were fine. I never had anything against scars. They always told a story about something that had happened. But why the fuck did these scars glow in a menacing red color? What the fuck was this? Who the fuck were these people?  Desperate to remember, I tried to think back to what I could remember. Explosions... the Normandy was under attack. Distress beacon got sent out. I remembered giving Kaidan the responsibility to get everyone to escape pods... what else? Come on, Jane, remember! I remembered Joker not wanting to go, as I had to physically go get him. Then a blast. I was... I got spaced...  How was I alive? Did someone manage to save me after all?  Shots were flying everywhere outside this room and I smelled smoke. We definitely were under attack. Perspective, Jane, you already know about this. I needed to get out alive before my questions could get answered and Miranda seemed keen on me making it out alive. What was attacking us? And where the fuck was I? As I looked around, this seemed to be more like a lab than a med-bay. So much equipment, stat readings, and I was on a fucking table, not a bed.  Miranda interrupted my thoughts. \"There\\'s a pistol in the locker on the other side of the room. Hurry!\"  I looked ahead and saw a locker. Getting to my feet was a little easier said than done at first. I wobbled a little but quickly found my footing again. It seemed like I had woken up from a long sleep, yet my strength didn\\'t seem to have diminished at all. Weird. The locker held a pistol as promised but unfortunately no armor. An M-3, though. Yuck.  \"There\\'s no thermal clips here.\" I noted out loud and hoped Miranda heard me.  \"You\\'ll find thermal clips outside this room.\" She answered me.  She could hear me. Good. The ammo was outside this room. Dropped by enemies, maybe? An exit was behind me but so were canisters on fire. That explained the smoke. Fuck! I threw myself behind an upturned table just as they exploded. Got lucky there, I guess. It blew the door open for me and I was happy to find a thermal clip right there. After loading it up, Miranda started to talk to me again.  \"Someone\\'s hacked our systems. Mechs are on the loose and killing everyone they can find. Get to the shuttles as quickly as you can.\"  An inside job. Great. Where the fuck were the shuttles? Right, perspective again. I could worry about that later, as I had to focus on making it out of this room alive now. As the doors in front of me opened, I saw the next room had been barricaded. I vaulted over and heard the awful mutterings of LOKI mechs telling me to calm down, stop firing and to surrender.  Fuck. I had no shields or armor. The M-3 was a shitty heavy pistol. I would have to be quick about this if I wanted to survive. I quickly placed a couple of shots in its head. It exploded, which surprised me, but it made me smile wide in return.  There was another door behind where the mech had stood. I opened it and noticed someone trying to fry the lock to the room I was in. Cover was in front of me and I got behind it to wait. As the doors blew open, four LOKI mechs entered the room. Noticing they exploded from headshots, I timed and placed my shots carefully as they grouped up. The first two exploded and finished off the other two in the room. I smiled yet again and the coast was clear.  I should have paid attention to my surroundings but I just didn\\'t have enough time to do so. What I did notice, was this yellow elongated hexagon sign with lines hugging the sides of it. I didn\\'t recognize it immediately, though it did tickle memories deep within me. I had seen this sign before somewhere. Fuck. Why couldn\\'t I remember?  I moved forward and was met by a glass wall. A huge YMIR mech was wailing on two rather helpless people in front of me with its machine gun. Their blood splattered against the glass wall as I stood there for a second too long. Miranda urged me on as we didn\\'t have time to take it out. I had to admit that I didn\\'t want to either.  To the left was another door and by it was a grenade launcher. I picked it up while smiling to myself. This was a lot better. Down from where I was, I could see a door opening and another five LOKI mechs entering. I fired a grenade in the middle of them. The explosion and chain-explosions from the mechs left yet another smile on my face.  I found an elevator to my left and rode it down. As I walked through the door the mechs below me had gone through, I heard Miranda\\'s comm link getting broken up. It sounded like she was trying to tell me that something was wrong with the comms which was redundant. I could hear that perfectly. And this only managed to stress me out more.  Fuck. My guide was gone and I was on my own in an unfamiliar ship. Or space station. I wasn\\'t too sure.  Did I have an omni-tool, at least? Of course not. No cloak to help me out and that stressed me a lot. Just me, my shitty M-3 and a grenade launcher. It looked like I would have to trust Miranda, a person I didn\\'t know at all, and head to the shuttles she had told me to get to. The only reprieve was that she was interested in me staying alive. Maybe there were some answers to what was going on around me.  A door took me to a data lab where I found Wilson\\'s personal log. He was complaining about not getting more credits when his boss so easily threw credits at the project itself. He sounded irritated by it. I also saw a log from Miranda, explaining how they\\'d cut corners to hurry the process. What fucking process and project? I shook my head. No answers and I couldn\\'t focus on this now. I needed to move forward.  I continued up some stairs, where I found a man shooting mechs from the other side of a walkway. He was a young man, probably around my age. His skin was dark, his hair was short and black, and his eyes were a deep brown. On his body was a heavy armor in the same black and white coloring I remembered seeing on Miranda. That yellow symbol was also on his armor.  \"Shepard? What the hell?\" He exclaimed as he finished them off.  He knew who I was? I guess most humans did, either from the Blitz, becoming the first human Spectre or from stopping Sovereign. I ran into cover next to him as more mechs entered from the other side. Maybe he could tell me what was going on.  \"What are you doing here? I thought you were still a work in progress.\" He asked me.  Work in progress? What the fuck did that mean? Did it have something to do with the scars I had on my body? I needed to calm down. It was difficult to not know what was going on but these people were unknown to me. I didn\\'t trust them at all and I didn\\'t want them to know that I was breaking apart from the confusion and fear that only kept growing inside me. So I did what I could to hide the fear and decided to ask for some information.  \"Are you with Miranda?\" I asked him while probably looking confused as hell and he gave me an understanding look.  \"Yeah... sorry. I forgot this is all new to you right now. I\\'m Jacob Taylor. I\\'ve been stationed here for-\" He started to explain.  He suddenly got out of cover to shoot a mech in the head. He missed and hit its shoulder instead. It made it fire back at him. He cursed under his breath as that happened and got back into cover. Not a good shot, huh?  \"Things must be worse than I thought if Miranda\\'s got you running around. I\\'ll fill you in, but we better get you to the shuttle first.\" Jacob said and I shook my head a little.  \"Look, I know this isn\\'t the best time. Can\\'t you just tell me what\\'s going on here?\" I asked and looked him straight in the eyes.  \"Fair enough. I\\'ll give you the quick version. You and your ship were attacked and destroyed. You were killed. Dead as dead can be when they brought you here. Our scientists spent the last two years putting you back together. You\\'ve been comatose, or worse, that whole time. Welcome back to your life.\" He explained calmly and slowly, and ended with a smile.  My breath faltered. So I had remembered it right. I did get spaced and I did die. Wait, did he say two years? That couldn\\'t be right. Two years? What the fuck? How fucking bad was it? No, this couldn\\'t be real. Who were these people? I couldn\\'t stop the confusion this time. Jacob saw that and offered up more details.  \"The Alliance declared you killed in action. The whole galaxy thinks you\\'re dead. And if we don\\'t get to those shuttles, they\\'ll be right.\" He said.  \"What about-\" I started to ask.  \"I\\'ll tell you what - you help me finish off these mechs, and I\\'ll play Twenty Questions with you all day.\" Jacob cut me off and gave me a stern look.  Right. Perspective again. I needed to focus on surviving first. He checked his ammo and grunted a little at whatever it was that he learned from seeing what he saw.  \"We\\'re low on thermal clips, but I\\'m a biotic. Just give the order when you want me to hit them with the good stuff.\" Jacob said and ended with a smile.  Fair enough, I guess. There were 4 mechs on the other side of the room. Ignoring Jacob\\'s call to use his biotics, I quickly got all the mechs in the head with a couple of headshots each. They exploded in unison. Jacob looked stunned and impressed at my display. I think I even saw a shiver run down his spine. Fanboy? It didn\\'t fucking matter if he was. We holstered our weapons before getting up to our feet. It was time to play Twenty Questions.  \"Okay, then. Well, I promised I\\'d answer your questions. What do you want to know?\" He asked.  \"Did anyone else on the Normandy make it?\" I asked again.  \"Just about everybody survived. A few servicemen from the lower decks didn\\'t get out. Navigator Pressly was killed by an explosion. But everyone else, including the non-Alliance crew - the asari, Liara, and the quarian - they all made it out alive.\" Jacob answered.  I was sure Pressly got killed in the first explosion in the Normandy. Even if we didn\\'t always agree, he was an honest and loyal man to work with. An excellent X.O. I was thankful for Liara and Tali making it out alive. That calmed me down a lot.  \"Do you know what any of them are doing now?\" I asked Jacob.  \"I don\\'t know, Commander. It\\'s been two years. They\\'ve moved on. Left the Alliance. Could be anywhere.\" Jacob answered slightly frustrated.  Why did that frustrate him? To me it was like I died an hour ago and woke up now. Was it so strange that I wanted to know if my squad had made it out alive? I logically knew it would be difficult to know everything for him. I logically also knew that more time had passed than what I felt like it had. But that wasn\\'t what it felt like at all. It actually confused me and I thought it was difficult to handle. I decided to ignore his tone, for now.  \"They were my team. If they knew I was alive, they\\'d come back.\" I added and I was sure about it, too.  \"Maybe you can track them down after we get off the station. If we get off the station.\" Jacob answered, slightly rolling his eyes with the last sentence.  His tone was pissing me off a little now, so I decided to change the subject. \"You said they spent two years rebuilding me? How bad were my injuries?\"  \"I\\'m no doctor, but it was bad. When I first saw you, you were nothing but meat and tubes. Anywhere else, they\\'d have put you in a coffin. But Project Lazarus was different. Cutting-edge technology.\" Jacob answered.  Meat and tubes. What did that mean? It sounded like they had revived me from some lump of flesh. How fucking hurt had I been? What was this cutting edge technology he was referring to? I closed my eyes and suppressed a shudder. What exactly was I?  \"What do you mean by that? Cloning? Cybernetics?\" I asked desperately.  \"I don\\'t know the details. You\\'d have to ask the scientists. But I\\'m pretty sure you\\'re not a clone. They wanted to bring you back exactly as you were. You\\'re still you... you just might have a few extra bits and pieces now.\" Jacob answered like he understood he\\'d been brash with his explanation.  Bits and pieces, huh? Sounded like cybernetics. How was the fact that I was alive even possible? This felt so wrong. I was supposed to be dead and they had broken nature\\'s laws by defying that and bringing me back for some reason. I felt unnatural. I was a freak.  \"Were there other test subjects in this Lazarus project?\" I asked as I desperately wanted to change the subject.  \"Project Lazarus only had one subject. The whole point was to bring you back. Just you. Even that was a challenge. Two years. All the top scientists. The best technology money could buy.\" Jacob answered.  Why, though? What was so fucking special about me? I wanted to ask but I could tell he didn\\'t know anything about it himself. He seemed to only be a simple guard. It would have to wait. I started focusing on the present threat and the most pressing issue: getting the fuck out of here.  \"What\\'s the quickest way to those shuttles?\" I asked, eager to get away from this station alive.  \"Depends where the mechs are thickest. It\\'s probably best if we-\" Jacob answered.  \"Check. Check. Anyone on this frequency? Anybody still alive out there? Hello?\" A man said through a radio.  I recognized his voice. It belonged to the man in the room with Miranda when I woke up that time. Wilson was his name, I remembered that now. Jacob even said it. He and Jacob talked for a while, before Wilson urged us to go to the service center.  We continued into an engineering room and were met by multiple mechs. Jacob and I finished them off quickly, before I could hear Jacob chastise Wilson for leading us there since the area was crawling with mechs. That was suspicious, I thought. Wouldn\\'t Wilson want to lead us to a safe location? But Wilson pointed out mechs were crawling all over the station and I guess that made some sense.  Exiting the room there was a staircase in front of us. Wilson howled about him being found by mechs and told us to go help him. Jacob and I picked up our paces and quickly found Wilson sitting behind some cover while gripping his leg in pain. I noticed there weren\\'t any mechs around, destroyed or alive. His leg didn\\'t actually look to be that hurt either.  So he was pissed about not being paid more, he led us to a dangerous location crawling with mechs, and there were no signs of him not being surrounded my these mechs that had attacked him. I gathered that he had to be the one who\\'d hacked the mechs. Only made sense when I thought about it.  However good my aim was, I couldn\\'t risk taking him out on my own. I didn\\'t say anything because I wanted to see if Jacob would figure it out, too. It was kinda obvious from my point of view and I was sure Wilson would make more comments telling me I was right. So I looked at Jacob and waited for him to figure it out, too.  Jacob urged me to find medi-gel and apply it to his leg instead. I did what I was told and thought that he probably just was a pretty face, then. He used an SMG, like some fucking crazy person would. He also had biotics and from what I had seen, it wasn\\'t that impressive. He could pull shit towards himself and that seemed to be it. He had incendiary ammo, tough. I guess that was nice.  But he didn\\'t seem to be that smart or that able. Maybe he just assumed that treason wasn\\'t an option for Wilson? Nah, he couldn\\'t be that innocent, could he? Humans were the best at treason, in my experience. Wilson and Jacob continued discussing what had happened and I zoned out while they did. I really didn\\'t care.  But then they started to argue, and I really couldn\\'t take right now. We needed to get off the station, not bicker like some fucking kids.  \"Listen, I don\\'t know where the fuck I am or who you are. I suggest we get to the fucking shuttles before this argument continues.\" I said sternly to both of them.  \"Right, Shepard. We need to find Miranda. We can\\'t leave her behind.\" Jacob said, agreeing with my decision.  \"Forget about Miranda. She was over in D wing. The mechs were all over that sector. There\\'s no way she survived.\" Wilson exclaimed.  Another big hint. Forget about the woman who seemed to be in charge and move fast enough to only save himself. I looked at Jacob, to see if he\\'d figured it out yet. Come on, man. You can do this.  \"A bunch of mechs won\\'t drop Miranda. She\\'s alive.\" Jacob answered and even narrowed his eyes slightly at Wilson.  After gauging his reaction, I understood that it wasn\\'t from suspicion, but from emotion. Miranda and Jacob apparently had history. They were both attractive people, so I guessed it made sense for them to hook up at some point. But Jacob still didn\\'t get it, huh?  \"Then where is she? Why haven\\'t we heard from her? There are only two possible explanations: she\\'s either dead... or she\\'s the traitor!\" Wilson exclaimed dramatically.  I rolled my eyes and sighed. Of course the traitor would try to place the blame on someone else. But if that was the case, then why the fuck would she even try to save me?  \"Then why did she do her best to save me?\" I asked Wilson with a knowing look.  I hoped Jacob would\\'ve figured it out by now. Wilson averted my gaze and decided to talk to Jacob. Yeah, buddy. I see you being a traitorous little asshole. Too bad there\\'s only one here that does, since pretty face over there seems to be blind as a fucking bat.  \"Okay, maybe she\\'s not the traitor. But that doesn\\'t change the fact. We\\'re here, she\\'s not. We need to save ourselves. The shuttle bay is only a few-\" Wilson said as mechs started filling the room.  The battle was short, due to a well-placed shot from Jacob to some explosives. Would you look at that. He\\'d finally done something useful. But as we were heading out of the room we were in, Jacob stopped and looked conflicted. He wanted to say something. Tell me something uncomfortable. I wasn\\'t sure if I wanted to know right now but that didn\\'t really stop him from speaking.  \"Okay, we took \\'em down, but this is getting tense. Shepard, if I tell you who we work for, will you trust me?\" Jacob asked.  \"This really isn\\'t the time, Jacob.\" Wilson shot in while looking nervous as hell.  \"We won\\'t make it if she\\'s expecting a shot in the back.\" Jacob retorted.  \"If you want to piss off the boss, it\\'s your ass, Jacob.\" Wilson answered defeated.  Oh, boy. This couldn\\'t be anything good at all. Would I trust Jacob if he told me? Fuck, no. Trust was difficult enough for me to begin with and I absolutely did not trust any of the people here. But I wanted to know who these people were. I looked at Jacob expectantly and saw him take a deep breath before he answered me.  \"The Lazarus Project, the program that rebuilt you... it\\'s funded and controlled by Cerberus.\" He said.  The name rang a bell but it didn\\'t immediately tell me anything. \"I think I ran into Cerberus a few times after I took down Saren. Some kind of pro-human splinter group, right?\"  More memories were coming back, and they were filled with husks, rachni, and Thorian creepers. Science experiments. Humans as test subjects. I started to feel sick to my stomach. They had moved from those to experimenting with reviving a corpse, huh? I guess the name Lazarus should\\'ve rang a bell. Terrorists. Fuck. I needed to play it cool if I wanted to live.  Jacob started to pace, clearly uncomfortable at the look on my face as I realized just who they were. \"Well, that\\'s what the Alliance wants you to believe. But there\\'s more to it. The Alliance declared you dead. They gave up. Cerberus spent a fortune to bring you back. Look, I\\'d be suspicious too. But right now, we have to work together. I thought you deserved to know what\\'s what. Once we\\'re off the station, I\\'ll take you to the Illusive Man. He\\'ll explain everything. I promise.\"  \"Illusive Man? Is he in charge of all this?\" I asked curiously and frustrated at not knowing anything at all.  \"Yeah. That\\'s not his real name, of course. Nobody knows who he really is.\" Wilson answered.  \"It was a code name the Alliance used for him. It kinda stuck.\" Jacob added.  I wondered why. He clearly said illusive and not elusive, though I gathered that he also was the latter if none knew his name. Illusive. Deceptive. Illusionary. Another crazy person belonging to this crazy group. I thought about the information I\\'d been given for a moment. Jacob being upfront with me did calm me a little down. Did it make me trust him? Well, like I expected, it absolutely did not. But I still needed to play it cool.  \"I respect you for telling me the truth, Jacob. Right now, we need to get out of here. We can discuss this later.\" I said calmly to Jacob as I turned around and continued walking.  We came to an open room and I could tell the shuttle would be close by. This felt like a shuttle bay, only on a more massive scale. A few mechs were lined up in front of us and above us. We all took care of them together quickly because we really didn\\'t have time to play around. I needed to get off this station as soon as possible and get the fuck back to the Citadel. We eventually came upon a locked door. It would need to be bypassed if we wanted to escape and Wilson ran up to it to do just that.  \"C\\'mon, through here. We\\'re almost at the...\" Wilson said but stopped as the doors opened.  A woman stood there and I recognized her from before. This was Miranda. The woman that, according to Wilson, was the traitor. She looked like a smart woman. Her face turned extremely sour when she saw Wilson right in front of her. I waited for the inevitable to happen and actually felt a little calm for not being the only one who could put two and two together.  \"Miranda! But, you were...\" Wilson only managed to say before Miranda put her pistol to his head and blew his head off.  \"Dead?\" She finished with narrowed eyes.  \"What the hell are you doing?\" Jacob asked frantically.  \"My job. Wilson betrayed us all.\" Miranda answered calmly.  \"Finally.\" I let out while shaking my head.  Miranda and Jacob both looked at me with completely different expressions. Miranda had a small smile on her face. Curt. Polite. Not happy or satisfied. Jacob only looked shocked. How can you say that, that kind of expression. I looked back at him disappointed.  \"I listened to a log where he talked about how disappointed he was at not getting paid more. Then he wailed about being hurt by mechs, yet there weren\\'t any where we found him. And lastly, he placed the blame on Miranda awfully quickly. Only a traitor is that quick to shift the focus onto someone else. Honestly, I thought you\\'d figure it out as quickly as I did.\" I explained to him and heard Miranda stifle a chuckle as it ended.  We quickly went to the shuttles. Miranda gave Jacob a disapproving look when she learned he already had told me about who they worked for. She then wanted me to meet the Illusive Man as soon as possible, which I had to admit I didn\\'t look forward to. The shuttle ride would take around 30 minutes in FTL speed. I leaned against my seat and rolled my neck while thinking about all the questions I had.  I\\'d been gone two whole years. First of all, how old was I? Would I still be considered 29 years old or was I 31 years old? My body felt stronger, like I was a teenager again. And it felt like that even if I hadn\\'t moved a muscle for those two years. That was probably thanks to the cybernetics. Most of my muscles had withered away. I was strong, but I didn\\'t look like I was. Now I just looked like some physically weak and curvy woman. I wondered how much of me was machine.  Was I thankful for being alive? That was a tricky one to answer. A second chance at life. Something everyone would be thankful for getting. But these people didn\\'t bring me back from the dead to be kind to me. I gathered they wanted me for something. What, I did not know, but I figured it had to be something big for them to throw practically unlimited resources at my revival. But it still felt like they had broken some sacred rule by doing this and that made me uncomfortable.  Cerberus, though. This was the part that scared me the most. It felt like I was in hostile territory. Like I was some kind of prisoner. Though they seemed keen to keep me alive. For what though? I did my best to stay as stoic and calm as I could while panic slowly started to build up inside me. They weren\\'t allowed to know how incredibly uncomfortable and scared I felt. So I needed to play along until I understood what they wanted from me.  The ultimate test of my deception skills from the Reds.  I thought back to my death and my time before I died. I remembered feeling regretful and sad over dying. It calmed me to know that I maybe would meet Vito on the other side. There was no way for me to remember if I did or not. But what I felt sad about was the blue eyes and blue clan markings belonging to my best friend. They kept me calm as I died.  I needed to find Garrus. First of all, I needed my best friend to know that I was alive again. He was something I could hang onto that I knew. Something familiar. Incredibly selfish of me, but he did on multiple occasions assure me that he would be there for me. Two years, though. I hoped he still remembered me. He was still my very best friend in my mind but I didn\\'t know if he would feel the same.  And then I thought back to what happened on that last night in his bedroom. He wanted to know what kissing felt like. So I showed him and felt everything to let me know that I definitely had feelings for him. Fuck. I even sent him that long and sappy e-mail the night before I died. Had he read it? What if he had and I met him again?  Fuck, this was so frustrating to think about. It wouldn\\'t really matter, would it? Two years had passed for him, even if it hadn\\'t for me. He\\'d probably moved on a long time ago if there was a mutual attraction there.  \"Commander, are you alright?\" Miranda said and broke my thoughts.  A tear had apparently escaped my eye. I felt it run down my cheek. Damn it. I needed to show that everything was fine, so I smiled to her.  \"Sorry. I was a little deep in thought. Did you say something?\" I asked.  \"Before you meet with the Illusive Man, we need to ask a few questions to evaluate your condition.\" She repeated.  \"Come on, Miranda. More tests? Shepard took down those mechs without any trouble. That has to be good enough.\" Jacob answered for me.  \"It\\'s been two years since the attack. The Illusive Man needs to know that Shepard\\'s personality and memories are intact. Ask the questions.\" Miranda answered sternly to Jacob.  My memories were intact, alright. I guess this made sense. They needed to show that I was myself again and healed - fuck me, all right - before I met the boss. They probably wanted to ask something from my past. Jacob gave me a defeated look. I nodded at him, telling him it was fine. He took a deep breath before he started talking.  \"Okay. Records show you were born on Earth. You were orphaned at age 11 and was picked up by a gang. You enlisted with the Alliance when you turned 18. You received the Star of Terra four years later, for holding off an attack on Elysium from batarian pirates on your own. Do you remember that?\" He asked.  \"There were a lot of batarians there that day. My squad were exhausted, and we were all badly hurt. Since I wasn\\'t hurt, I snuck around their frigate and killed them on my own. And I didn\\'t stop before every single one of them were dead and all the hostages were freed. I got shot in my shoulder and legs. I also lost someone close to me that day.\" I answered calmly and made an effort to not go into great detail.  \"I read the mission report. You saved the colony that day. It\\'s said that Elysium wouldn\\'t still be standing if it wasn\\'t for you.\" Jacob answered with admiration in his eyes.  It wasn\\'t just me, though. It was a team effort, but I didn\\'t want to go into great detail about it. I just did the right thing that day. People needed to be saved and I was the only one capable of doing it. Besides, Vito died that day. That overshadowed anything good that came from Elysium for me personally. And the Star of Terra? Fuck, I didn\\'t care about that at all.  Jacob looked at Miranda. \"Satisfied?\"  \"Almost. Let\\'s try something more recent. Virmire, where you destroyed Saren\\'s cloning facility. You had to leave one of your squad behind to die in the blast.\" Miranda started telling me.  \"Gunnery Chief Ashley Williams was killed in action. It was your call. Why did you leave her behind?\" Jacob said as he finished the question for Miranda.  Ash flooded my mind. A woman I didn\\'t agree with when it came to her suspicions of aliens, but as I got to know her more, I understood it had to be the Alliance she really was angry with. She ended up as someone I saw as a friend. An honest and fun woman who wasn\\'t afraid to speak her mind. I smiled as I thought about her again.  \"I left a friend to die that day, and I didn\\'t do it casually. I had to save as many people as I could and Ash gave her life for the rest of the team. Without her, we couldn\\'t have stopped Saren. She died a hero.\" I answered assuredly.  \"I understand, Commander. And I wasn\\'t judging your decision. Everybody at Cerberus knows that cloning facility had to be destroyed.\" Jacob said with a sympathetic smile.  I gave him a fake appreciative smile back. Just as curt as what Miranda seemed to give me. I didn\\'t give a fuck about what Cerberus though about my decisions when we went after Saren. These people thought science experiments on living people were fine. Experiments involving husks, creepers and rachni. The bar for what would be considered right wasn\\'t high at all.  \"There are other tests we really should run-\" Miranda said but Jacob cut her off.  \"Come on, Miranda. Enough with the quizzes. The memories are there, and I can vouch for Shepard\\'s combat skills personally.\" He said giving her a frustrated look.  \"I suppose you\\'re right. We\\'ll have to hope the Illusive Man accepts out little field test as evidence enough.\" Miranda said backed off.  I looked out of the window of the shuttle and could see we were coming up to a huge station. It was impressive-looking and fairly well hidden away. It looked like a place where secret stuff would go down. We got out of the shuttle and walked up to what looked like a waiting area. Miranda ended up sitting down in front of a terminal to work. Jacob stood by a weapons display.  \"Shepard, before you go meet the Illusive Man, you\\'re welcome to change your clothing.\" Miranda said to me and nodded towards what could only be a bathroom.  I nodded and went into the bathroom to see what they had in mind. An undersuit. That meant that they most likely wanted me for combat purposes. What did they want me to fight that other soldiers couldn\\'t?  The first thing I did was avoid the mirror at all costs. The undersuit looked like they always did. No progress in development for two years, huh? Well, they were perfect the way they were. There was even a sports bra lying here for me. It was even the right size, a 34C, and I shuddered at the thought of Cerberus seeing every inch of my body. Touching it. Rebuilding it. I had been meat and tubes when they got their hands on me. How extensive was this rebuild? Fuck.  I put on the skin-tight bodysuit and did my best to not look at my own body. My abdomen didn\\'t hurt anymore, which I thought was strange. I ignored the red scars on my arms and legs and tried to forget the fact that I saw them all over my abdomen and breasts as I put my bra on.  But like it was fucking muscle memory, I looked at my face in the mirror and started to shake as I did. My hair was long, I already knew that, but it had been shaved off at the right side of my head. Like some sort of side cut. And then I couldn\\'t look away. Glancing at my own face, I saw that my scar from Palaven still was there. Keeping it company was a lot of red and glowing scars on my face itself. A big and deep one was where they had shaved my face.  I looked away, shook and struggled not to panic. What the fuck was I? Could I even be considered human anymore? This felt like I was close to what Saren wanted. A perfect meld of machine and organic. Like some fucking freak that shouldn\\'t be alive.  Perspective. I needed to calm down. I was still in hostile territory and needed to play along for them to not understand that nothing was wrong. Their boss needed to understand that I wouldn\\'t do anything, because I feared that would mean serious consequences for me or others.  Decent and dressed, I walked out of the bathroom and was pointed to a set of stairs. They led to an empty room with a circle in the middle. Was I supposed to stand inside it? Did this mean I would have a virtual meeting with the Illusive Man? I guessed it did and stood inside the circle. A grid formed around me as I got scanned.  After a couple of seconds of scanning I looked around. There was a huge red giant sun in the background. In front of it sat a man in an office chair. He looked like he was in his early 60\\'s. He had boyish dark hair, a nice suit on and was smoking a cigarette. His eyes caught mine right away. They were glowing in an intense blue color. I\\'d never seen anything like it before.  \"Commander Shepard.\" He said politely as he took a drag of his cigarette.  \"Illusive Man. I thought we\\'d be meeting face-to-face.\" I said as I crossed my arms over my chest, earning me a small smirk.  \"A necessary precaution. Not unusual for people who know what you and I know.\" He answered while giving me an intense stare.  What him and I knew? Thinking about what that would mean was difficult. That could really be anything. Was it the fact that they experimented on live people? This wasn\\'t the time to be sarcastic, though. There was really only one answer to this question. It was the answer everyone else seemed to not believe. Something I had seen with my own eyes and knew would be coming soon.  \"The Reapers.\" I answered for him.  \"Good to see your memory\\'s still intact. How are you feeling?\" He answered as he flicked his cigarette.  I gave him a small smile. \"Let\\'s just skip the pleasantries and get to what you want with me.\"  \"Cerberus isn\\'t as evil as you believe. You and I are on the same side; we just have different methods.\" He answered as he took another drag of his cigarette.  Didn\\'t believe him, but wouldn\\'t argue about it either. \"Cut the bullshit. What are the Reapers doing that made you decide to bring me back?\"  The Illusive Man stood up from his chair and walked over to my projection. Intensely. Like this was something he really cared about. He wanted me to believe that he cared about this, too. I listened, just because I had to.  \"We\\'re at war. No one wants to admit it, but humanity is under attack. While you\\'ve been sleeping, entire colonies have been disappearing. Human colonies. We believe it\\'s someone working for the Reapers. Just as Saren and the geth aided Sovereign. You\\'ve seen it yourself. You bested all of them. That\\'s just one reason we chose you.\" He explained.  \"Fighting a war doesn\\'t seem like Cerberus. Why are you involved?\" I asked.  \"We are committed to the advancement and preservation of humanity. If the Reapers are targeting us, trying to wipe us out, Cerberus will stop them. If we wait for the politicians or the Alliance to act... no more human colonies will be left.\" He answered with a smug smile.  I didn\\'t have an answer for that because he was right. What was sad was that he just told me that Cerberus probably wouldn\\'t have helped if this was happening to other species in this galaxy. They only cared because something was attacking humans.  \"Sovereign was trying to harvest all life in the galaxy. Why would the Reapers target a few human colonies?\" I asked.  \"Hundreds of thousands of colonists have vanished. I\\'d say that fits the definition of \\'harvesting\\'. Nobody\\'s paying attention because it\\'s random and the attacks occur in remote locations. I don\\'t know why they\\'ve suddenly targeted humanity. Maybe you got their attention when you killed one of them.\" The Illusive Man answered.  \"If this is a threat against humanity, you need to mobilize the Alliance.\" I pointed out because they were humanity\\'s guardians.  \"They suffered substantial losses fighting Sovereign. They\\'re rebuilding, still stretched too thin to waste resources verifying the Reaper threat. Blaming the abductions on mercs and pirates is easier. And more convenient.\" He answered.  I wouldn\\'t fucking know either way because I had apparently been gone for two fucking years. For all I knew, that would be right. I did sacrifice some ships to save the Council themselves. Quite a few got taken out by Sovereign itself. It made rational sense that they would be struggling right now.  \"You know, you could have trained an entire army for what you spent to bring me back.\" I pointed out and heard him chuckle.  \"You\\'re unique. Not just in ability or what you\\'ve experienced, but in what you represent. You stood for humanity at a key moment. You\\'re more than a solider - you\\'re a symbol. And I don\\'t know if the Reapers understand fear, but you killed one. They have to respect that.\" The Illusive Man answered as he gave me a respectful look.  I didn\\'t just stand for humanity. I stood for all of us. But I didn\\'t feel like pointing that out to him at all, in case that would get me into trouble.  I thought for a moment. The Reapers were my plight and I was alone in it, at least two years ago. Now there were someone out there who were just as interested in them as I was. They wanted me to continue the fight against the Reapers. Helping out the enemy wasn\\'t my style, but if they would throw resources my way so I could look more into what the Reapers were doing...  I didn\\'t have a choice anyway.  \"If what you say is true... if the Reapers are behind this... I\\'d consider helping you.\" I concluded.  The Illusive Man gave me a satisfied smile before he headed back to his chair. He sat down, crossed his legs and kept looking at me with that boyish look on his face. Those eyes, man. Cybernetics? Something else? I wasn\\'t sure and I wasn\\'t sure I wanted to ask about it either.  \"I\\'d be disappointed if you accepted any of this without seeing for yourself. I have a shuttle ready to take you to Freedom\\'s Progress, the latest colony to be abducted. Miranda and Jacob will brief you.\" He said.  An investigation right away. No sleep for the fucking wicked and it was time to be stressed again for however long this would take. This man and the people I\\'d met in Cerberus seemed to be interested in me being alive and showed some sense of respect. Admiration from some, even. Was I really a prisoner here, or was I allowed to leave?  \"Is this a volunteer job, or am I being volunteered?\" I asked.  \"You always have a choice, Shepard. If you don\\'t find the evidence we\\'re both looking for, we can part ways. But go to Freedom\\'s Progress first. Find any clues you can. Who\\'s abducting the colonies? Do they have any connection to the Reapers? I brought you back. It\\'s up to you to do the rest.\" The Illusive Man answered as he hung up on me.  I was back in the room I was in and stood there alone. All right. I guess I could investigate if this had anything to do with the Reapers first. If it did, then stopping them still was important. Cerberus seemed to have a lot of resources on hand. That would be helpful with this plight. Besides, focusing on something else kept me calm in the moment. I would need that calmness to get through this so I could escape.  I walked up the small set of stairs and saw that Miranda was still at her terminal. I decided to go talk to her. If I was working with these people, I at least wanted to know more about them. Besides, she would brief me. I also gathered that the Illusive Man wanted me in charge of this, so I wanted to make sure that everyone would follow my lead.  \"The Illusive Man is very impressed with you. I\\'m eager to see if you can live up to his expectations on this mission.\" Miranda said curtly as I headed over to her.  \"I can\\'t have anyone disobeying my commands when we get there.\" I noted calmly to her.  \"I know who I report to. As long as you don\\'t do anything to betray Cerberus, I\\'ll follow your orders.\" Miranda answered curtly.  She clearly didn\\'t like me, for some reason. I still needed to stay on their good side, for now. So I started buttering her up and thanking her for what they\\'d done. I wasn\\'t sure if I even meant it.  \"I never got a chance to say how much I appreciated what the Lazarus Project did for me.\" I said to her.  \"I just hope it was worth it. A lot of people lost their lives on that station.\" Miranda said giving me the same curt smile.  \"We have to work together here. Your attitude isn\\'t helping anything.\" I pointed out to her with my own curt smile.  \"I have the utmost respect for your abilities, Shepard. It\\'s your motives that concern me. I believe in what Cerberus stands for. Only time will tell if you prove to be an asset or a liability to our cause.\" Miranda answered and gave me her own irritated stare.  \"Can you tell me more about the Lazarus Project? You were in charge.\" I asked to her to see if I could pry more information on the matter from her.  \"I wasn\\'t in charge. The Illusive Man was. If I was running the show, we\\'d have done a few things differently.\" Miranda answered.  \"What would you have changed?\" I asked curiously.  \"To start, I would have implanted you with some type of control chip. But the Illusive Man wouldn\\'t allow it. He was afraid it might affect your personality - alter your character somehow. He wouldn\\'t let us do anything that might limit your potential in any way.\" Miranda said regretfully.  I chuckled and felt happy that this didn\\'t happen. It told me that my mind was my own, at least. They couldn\\'t tell me what to do and since the Illusive Man wanted me in charge, at least in this mission, that somehow calmed me down a lot.  \"Yeah, I can\\'t say I like the idea of being brought back to life with a control chip in my brain.\" I admitted happily.  \"The Illusive Man is taking an incredible risk with you. I just hope his gamble pays off.\" Miranda said still looking annoyed as ever.  I decided to change the subject to see if that would calm her down. I needed to know more about this colony we were visiting. Get briefed, basically.  \"What can you tell me about this colony we\\'re going to?\" I asked her.  \"Freedom\\'s Progress? It\\'s a typical human settlement in the Terminus Systems. They had a small military force for protection supplemented by mechs and security drones. Average in almost every way, really. Completely unremarkable... until the disappearance.\" Miranda answered.  I wondered why they would get hit, then. Maybe it was the location and the fact that they were so unremarkable. No one would think twice about them being wiped out. It actually made sense for them to get hit, the more I thought about it.  \"Tell me a little about yourself.\" I said while trying to give her a small smile.  \"Worried about my qualifications? I can crush a mech with my biotics or shoot its head off at 100 yards. Take your pick.\" Miranda answered and I could hear her getting more hostile.  \"Fine. I\\'m sorry for talking to you.\" I answered her and left her alone.  She was an intense person and it was obvious she didn\\'t like me. I didn\\'t necessarily need her to like me. I just needed her boss to understand that I wouldn\\'t do anything stupid. Her sour tone almost rubbed off on me, but I was determined to not let it bring me down. I shook the feeling out of my body and went over to Jacob. I wanted to get to know him better as well.  He smiled at me as I walked over to him. \"I\\'m glad the Illusive Man convinced you to join us, Commander.\"  \"I just want to find out what happened to those missing people. I\\'m not joining anyone.\" I answered honestly.  He nodded in understanding. \"Noted. Do you trust me, Commander?\"  That was the second time he said something about me trusting him and what a weird fucking question it was. I didn\\'t know him well enough to have made up my mind on the matter. Of course I didn\\'t fucking trust him, but I didn\\'t want to be that honest about it yet. This was still hostile territory to me. Jacob did seem honest and empathetic, if a little useless. But trust him? Fuck, no.  \"I don\\'t really know you. You seem like a good man but you might be working for the wrong people.\" I said with a shrug.  \"Maybe. But I thought the same when I was with the Alliance. That\\'s why I\\'m here now.\" Jacob answered.  He had been in the Alliance? I wondered why he left to join a pro-human organization that seemed to think science experiments were a lot of fun to do. Maybe he liked that kind of stuff. But the Illusive Man had said that Jacob also could brief me and so I asked.  \"Do you know anything about this colony we\\'re going to?\" I asked.  \"It\\'s called Freedom\\'s Progress. Don\\'t know much else. I guess we\\'ll find out when we get there.\" Jacob answered while shrugging his shoulders.  Bad at doing research, just like me. A little worse than me, when I thought about it. Now, I had gotten a lot better at it while we were hunting down Sovereign, but I was still bad at it. I guess I was told wrong, then. He couldn\\'t help inform me of anything. I let it go and focused on his time in the Alliance.  \"You said you served in the Alliance?\" I asked feeling curious.  \"Five years in total. Stationed all over the galaxy. Even spent a couple of years as a Corsair.\" Jacob answered.  \"I\\'ve never heard of the Corsairs.\" I admitted.  \"It was an Alliance initiative. They hired independent starship captains and used them for missions that fell outside official Alliance jurisdiction. Technically, we weren\\'t a part of the Alliance. If we ever got caught, they could disavow any knowledge of us. We were supposed to be free from restrictions and rules, but there was still enough red tape to sink a cruiser. I finally just gave up.\" He explained and I nodded in realization.  The short version would be that he was hired muscle for the Alliance. Like mercs. As he brought up the red tape, my thought immediately went back to Garrus. I smiled sadly to myself as I thought about him. This was eerily similar to the same type of frustration that he felt regarding the red tape.  \"Why go to Cerberus, though?\" I asked.  \"I guess I just got tired of never making a difference. So much of what we did in the Alliance seemed pointless. I thought things would change after the attack on the Citadel. Humanity was finally invited to join the Council. But nothing changed. Politics. Bureaucracy. Same bullshit, different leaders. Cerberus is different. When colonies go missing, we don\\'t commission a team to write a report to figure out what the hell to do about it. We just go and find out.\" Jacob explained eagerly.  I guess I could respect his reasoning. How could I not? It was basically like hearing Garrus complaining on the SR1. Fuck, I missed him a lot and I wondered if he was okay. I wished he was here to keep me grounded and give me the strength I needed to face whatever this would be with these mad fucking people. Thinking about him made my eyes well up slightly again from tears but I managed to stop the meltdown before it happened.  \"I guess it\\'s off to Freedom\\'s Progress, then. Where are my weapons?\" I asked him as I looked around.  \"You can take your pick of weapons over there.\" He answered and gestured to an armory.  I nodded and walked up to it. After looking through it quickly, I couldn\\'t find what I was looking for. Maybe I had worded myself wrong, so I turned to face him while shaking my head.  \"No. Where is my Black Widow, my M-5, my talon and my Savant omni-tool?\" I asked and hoped the question was clear enough this time.  \"They aren\\'t here.\" Jacob answered.  I closed my eyes and took a few breaths to try and calm down. \"And why aren\\'t they here?\"  Jacob eyed Miranda with what could only be some sort of pleading look. He told her to help him out because he sensed that I was getting frustrated and stressed and maybe even a little angry. He wasn\\'t wrong. My weapons were my tools. Not only did I love them and took great care of them, but they were also something I could hang onto that I knew. Something that was me.  But their silence told me everything I needed to know, didn\\'t it? They didn\\'t get a hold of my body first. My tools were gone. Forever, maybe, and it made me almost freak out. What also freaked me out, was thinking about how many others that had played scientist with my body before Cerberus got their paws on me.  \"Who the fuck had my body first?\" I demanded from Miranda.  \"We don\\'t know. We\\'re not the one who got a hold of your body first. Your weapons and omni-tool were most likely looted and sold on the black markets.\" She answered honestly.  As much as it saddened me, I nodded and hoped this next question would have a more positive answer. \"Do you at least have my Armax armor?\"  \"Yes. We have the light version and the medium version. But not right here.\" She answered me while nodding.  \"Well. At least that\\'s something, I guess. Let me see what you have available.\" I said and took a look at the makeshift armory.  They had all types of weapons here. SMGs which were a big no right away. I hated SMGs. Shotguns and assault rifles were here, too, but those weren\\'t for me at all. Of course they didn\\'t have talons, but I found a combat knife that looked okay. I took it.  I went to the sniper rifles first and had two choices in front of me. The Mantis, which would be a good one-shot choice. But it didn\\'t match how I preferred to work. They had a Viper. 12 shots per clip, but weak as fuck. That had been my training weapon in the Alliance. It would need two precise headshots to take anything down. With that huge pool, it would be okay.  Heavy pistols. I worked with that and liked them for finishing off things quickly. They only had M-3s here, though. Fuck, they sucked so much. It felt weird that they didn\\'t have M-5s. They weren\\'t that hard to come by. But maybe an M-3 with a cranial trauma mod could work well enough until I got my hands on an M-5 and bought another Black Widow.  I looked around and had trouble finding the mods, so I looked back at Jacob. \"Any mods?\"  \"Not at this station.\" He answered and I sighed frustrated.  \"Right. Shitty choices it is, then. From what I learned from your logs, Cerberus has all the credits in the galaxy, and you can\\'t even afford any decent choices for weapons? That\\'s pitiful, if anything.\" I pointed out through my frustration.  \"I didn\\'t know you were a connoisseur of weapons, ma\\'am.\" He said to try and lighten the mood.  Nah, I wasn\\'t in the mood for jokes or being called ma\\'am today. I was in an unknown territory working with a terrorist organization and had people I didn\\'t know all around me. Anger enveloped me as I looked back at him and this time I couldn\\'t hold back the sarcastic and frustrated answer he got.  \"Well, I thought you knew everything about me. If you did, then you would know that I work with a Black Widow, an M-5, a Savant omni-tool and a talon. What kind of an omni-tool is this anyway? A Polaris, huh? Well. I guess you didn\\'t go the completely shitty route with that, at least.\" I answered as I picked up an omni-tool.  Silence for a few seconds and then Miranda took control. \"Have we been unreasonable to you in any way?\"   Perspective, you fucking idiot.   I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. This wasn\\'t the time to freak out at all. I needed to calm down and get a hold of myself as quickly as possible. They still needed to know that I could handle myself even if this was a new situation to me. Being adaptable was supposed to be my thing. So I holstered an M-3 and a Viper to my back and packed a lot of thermal clips.  \"No. Sorry. Let\\'s just keep going.\" I answered before I was led to my armor.  \"Garrus? I need you to drop whatever you\\'re doing and come meet me.\"  Sidonis tried to sound tempting with that but he lied. His sub-vocal chords were laced with nervousness and stress. This immediately felt wrong. But I trusted him. We had started this group together and I was sure he wouldn\\'t lead me into something dangerous for no reason at all. I still wanted to make sure he was all right, though.  \"Are you all right? You sound-\"  He calmed down with a chuckle and cut me off right away. \"I\\'m fine. Just ran into a little trouble on a job out here and could use a hand. Garm and his Blood Pack thought they could pull a fast one on us. They\\'re running guns down here in the Kenzo District. Big operation.\"  That immediately caught my attention. \"How big?\"  \"More than I could chew, but nothing the two of us can\\'t handle together. Like old times.\" He answered.  He used those words. The ones he knew I would listen to right away. They meant everything to me just because the old times were the best time of my life. I nodded, which he couldn\\'t see anyway, and decided to go help him out.  \"It\\'ll get me a while to get down there. Hang tight.\" I assured him, hung up and started to make my way down to Kenzo.   This smells like a trap, big guy.   Her voice again and it was still so incredibly bitter-sweet to hear. She was already with me in my dreams all the damned time and I sometimes heard her voice in my head, too. Like a guide making comments about what kind of situation we were in. Dad would have explained it as being her spirit helping me in my time of need. I knew it was just my own thoughts making themselves known and the fact that I missed her made those thoughts sound like her. But that logic didn\\'t really stop me from pretending it really was her.  The dreams were intense and I both hated and treasured them. They came almost every single night and mostly consisted of that last night she was with me on her shore leave before she went to work and died. She always straddled me and did whatever she could to turn me on. Lick and bite my neck. Massage that sensitive spot under my fringe. Grind her body against mine. I always grabbed her ass and pushed her closer to me to egg her on. Then she would always say something to me that I never heard before I woke up.  I hated them because it was a potential future that could never happen. She was my best friend but I think I came to realize a little too late that I had some feelings for her. I wanted her. But Jane was dead, and so it never could happen. And I loved them because I still couldn\\'t let her go, even after two damned years.  This time the voice was to warn me and I smiled as I heard it in my head. This is Sidonis, softy. Of course he wouldn\\'t lead me right into a trap. We had been working together for two years on Omega, you knew that already. Like he said, he was pinned down and probably a little stressed about the situation. He just needed me to back him up.  And so I made my way to the Kenzo district carefully. It did take some time. There was an awful silence as I came upon the district and my visor picked up no signs of any life. Where were all the mercs? Where was the fighting? No sound at all. I looked around carefully while staying as hidden as I could. Where the fuck was Sidonis?  A heavy feeling spread in my stomach as I understood that softy maybe was right about this one. The Kenzo district was on the almost opposite side to where our small little operation were holed up in Kima. Had he been stressed and nervous about the fact that he was caught? Did they tell him to lead me away?  Did he screw us all to save his own ass?  Fire ignited as I ran as fast as I could back to the Kima district. Took the backdoor, of course. Underground tunnels and that\\'s how we always came back to our spot. It was so silent. Too silent. But the scent of blood was heavy in the air. Fuck. I really didn\\'t need to look. Softy had been right all along. And I had failed them all.  Going upstairs, I found them. Ripper, Vortash, Weaver, Butler, Mierin, Erash, Sensat, Monteague, Melenis, Grundan... but not Sidonis. The fucker actually set me up and screwed us over to save his own ass. A few of them were alive. Barely. They were close to death and I stayed with them until they passed.  Noise coming from across the bridge caught my attention. Mercs. A lot of mercs. Eclipse, Blood Pack and Blue Suns? They\\'d teamed up together and wanted to play, huh? I was angry enough to do it but I took a good look at my situation before I did anything at all.  Disadvantages: I was alone. I had limited thermal clips. Waves of attackers would come at me. No time for sleep, much less food.  Advantages: I had the high ground. They had cornered me on my turf right into the spot we used to take them down. The bridge would funnel them right into scope for me. We had nutrient paste and a small, but healthy stock of thermal clips here.  No matter how I looked and thought about this, this would end in my death. So if this was to be my last stand, then I would make sure that I got as many of those little fuckers as I could before I went down.  I would do what I could to prove myself and earn my place next to her in the afterlife. From what I had researched humans had a lot of explanations to where their spirits went after death. None of them sounded right, until I came across Valhalla. It would be a great hall where fighting and partying would take place every single day. We would party together and fight like we meant it. Maybe even spend our nights together, too. Live out that dream I had every night.  Allergies probably didn\\'t exist in the afterlife, right? If it did then... fuck, that would suck, wouldn\\'t it?  I wondered if she would be my Valkyrie? Would she come and guide my spirit to the other side? I always pictured it would happen like that. Now was the time to work hard to make sure that I actually would be right.'"

       "'In a world were 98 percent of people are born with some sort of supernatural power, and it was called as quirks. We are about to see the life of a young boy who was born without one in the world of quirks. His name is Izuku Midoriya. He is a 14 old year boy and he was quirkless. For the past thirteen years his life was a living hell. He suffered many things that not any child should not even imagine, and it was all because he didn\\'t have a mutation. \\n\\nHe was announced as quirkless as if it was some disease. From his former childhood best-friend to his own parents, everybody hated him. Katsuki Bakugo, has treated him like he was a dirt, and even his mother has never once even supported him or acted as a mother for him. He was not allowed to call her as mother because she was ashamed to be the mother of a quirkless boy. His father who left him and his mother at the age of 4 because he was quirkless. \\n\\nHe had given up on everything except his dream, because he was not the one to be give up that easily. He wanted to help people just like All Might said and he would smile just like him. He was only 4 years from U.A university entrance exam.\\n\\n(\"I\\'ve got to work harder if I want to be able to get into U.A. as it is my only choice being quirkless.\") Izuku thought as he walked to school from his home after finishing house chores since it was a payment to his mother for allowing him to live under a roof. \\n\\nHe heard a fight breaking out and ran there instead to see who was fighting. \"Who\\'s fighting?\" He asked as he pushed his way to the front of the crowd. From there he could see the rookie hero Kamui Woods fighting off against a giant shark-man on railroad tracks. \\n\\nAt that moment Kamui started to create more vine like tendrils of wood from his arm as he prepared his ultimate attack \"Lacquered Chain Prison!\". But before he could finish executing his super move a giant kicked the giant man followed by a loud voice \"Canyon Canon.\" \\n\\nA giant blonde haired lady shouted as she performed a flying kick on the giant villain. She landed and turned her attention towards the public \"Today is the day of my Debut, my name is Mt. Lady. A pleasure to make your ass-quaintance.\" She said as she posed for the cameras that surrounded her.\\n\\nIzuku started to take notes about what the new hero\\'s quirk could possibly be. The man next to him looked at him before speaking up. \"Hey wait, you\\'re take notes? You wanna be a hero huh? That\\'s great, good luck\" The man said giving a thumbs up to Izuku who looked surprised for a second before smiling a genuine smile towards the man and thanking him for the words, Izuku went to his school.\\n\\n==========================================================\\n\\nIzuku was sitting in his bench just watching the birds flying outside the window while his whole class was shouting and playing. It was peaceful for Izuku until... His blonde haired teacher entered the classroom carrying a stack of papers with a serious expression.\\n\\n\"So, as 3rd year students, its time to think seriously about your future and what you want to do with your lives\" He said with a serious expression before he threw all the papers in the air with a smirk on his face.\\n\\n\"But why bother, I know you all want to be heroes\" He said happily as the whole classroom except Izuku and Bakugo went uproar and the students started to show off their quirks.\\n\\n\"Yes, yes you\\'ve got some very impressive quirks, but no quirk usage in school, so get a hold of yourself\"\\n\\n\"Hey teach, don\\'t lump me and my gang in with this group of losers\" A voice said as everyone turned and found Bakugo sitting in his bench with his legs on the table cockily. \"I am not gonna be stuck with these rejects at the bottom.\" He bragged as he smirked cockily.\\n\\nAt that claim, the whole class turned against him and shouted in outrage \"Huh? That\\'s uncalled for Katsuki!\"\\n\\nBut Bakugo just mocked them further more. \"You all should shut up like the extras you are!\"\\n\\nThe teacher silenced the class and started reading Bakugo and other\\'s results. \"Oh, I see, you want to go to U.A. University, right Bakugo?\"\\n\\nThe whole class gasped except Bakugo who smirked. All were whispering about the shocking news and how it was impossible to join U.A. At the back of the classroom Izuku just lied down already knowing where this was going and he likely was going to suffer more today.\\n\\n\"That\\'s exactly why you guys are just extras!\" Bakugo said mockingly as he jumped on top of his bench and started bragging more. \\n\\n\"I aced the mock test! I am the only one who could possibly get into U.A. from this school. I\\'ll be the one to surpass All Might and become the top Hero and my name will be inscribed in the list op top earners .\" Bakugo shouted this as he raised his hand into a fist and laughed.\\n\\nThe teacher soon read the next sheet and smirked planning something for fun.\\n\\n\"Oh yeah, Midoriya you want to go to U.A. too right?\" The teacher asked mockingly looking at Izuku knowing the outcome full well. The whole class became silent while Bakugo froze after that sentence and Izuku glared at his teacher for setting him up. Suddenly, the whole class except Bakugo laughed looking at Izuku.\\n\\n\"Huh? Midoriya? No way!\"\\n\\n\"You can\\'t get into the Hero course just by studying!\"\\n\\nIzuku was just sitting silently trying to calm himself until Bakugo came and blasted his bench into two which made Izuku getting launched into the back wall of the class.\\n\\n\"Hey, Deku! You\\'re below the rejects! You\\'re Quirkless!\" Bakugo shouted as small explosions popped in his hands.\\n\\n\"How can you even stand in the same ring as me?\" Bakugo shouted all the while Izuku just sat at the ground with shadow covering his eyes.\\n\\n\"Are you taking the test for fun?! What the hell can you do? You\\'re Quirkless\" Bakugo shouted as everyone joined her and glared at Izuku.\\n\\nSlowly the teacher silenced the class and proceeded with the homeroom while Bakugo glared at Izuku with hatred.\\n\\n==========================================================\\n\\nIt was the end of the day, and Izuku was packing up his stuff, He was about to grab his hero notebook when a hand grabbed it first and snatched it away. Izuku looked up and saw it was Bakugo standing with his goons all glaring at him. He mentally sighed fed up of dealing with them.\\n\\n\"We\\'re not done talking yet, Deku.\" Bakugo said as all the three looked at his notebook. \"You\\'re still writing these stupid stalker notebooks?\"\\n\\nIzuku just looked at them not wanting to deal with them. \"Just give it back\"\\n\\nBut Bakugo just blasted the notebook and threw the notebook outside the window into a koi pond irritating Izuku further more.\\n\\n\"There are many stories about top heroes from their school days and we want to be the only ones to be able to make into U.A. from this shitty school\" Bakugo said as he raised his hands and burned Izuku\\'s shoulder which he didn\\'t even flinch already got used to it. He smiled a creepy smile and told in a sickly sweet voice about not applying to U.A. and many things which Izuku tuned out already getting bored with the usual bullying. Those three went and Izuku sighed as he took his bag. But Bakugo smirked and told him a thing which will soon change his life.\\n\\n\"If you wanna be a Hero that badly, there\\'s a quick way to do it.\" Everyone look at him curiously and Izuku just raised his eyebrow doubting anything good will come from that mouth of his.\\n\\nHe continued \"Believe that you\\'ll be born with a quirk in your next life and take a last chance dive off the roof!\" and walked off laughing with his goons not noticing how Izuku froze.\\n\\nIzuku\\'s eyes went wide, and his heart rate was rising rapidly. He had already got death jokes and spider lilies before... But he didn\\'t think Bakugo would sink so lowly. Izuku stood there frozen for some time with an emotionless look, slowly calming himself and started to go to his home. \\n\\n==========================================================\\n\\nIzuku walked towards a tunnel, while a Sludge was rising through a manhole near it. Izuku looked back and saw a huge Sludge villain forming. Izuku started shaking after seeing the Sludge villain again but stopped trying to maintain his composure.\\n\\nThe villain spoke with a ugly smile on his face, \"You\\'ll make a perfect skin suit for me to hide in, kid.\" As Izuku tried to run, the villain captured him and started to go inside him through his mouth. The villain told him not to fight back so it will be easier for both. Izuku struggle was slowing down due to lack of oxygen. A blue streak appeared from the manhole and it\\'s cover flew. All Might came out of the sewer and saved him. \\n\\nAnd just like that, All Might turned around and crouched down as if to jump away. Izuku saw his opportunity to ask something weighing on his mind slipping away and finally found his voice. \"Wait! All Might! I- I have a question before you leave!\" He shouted, holding into the hem of his jacket nervously. \"Just one!\"\\n\\nWhat followed was the single worst decision Izuku had ever made in his life. Grabbing onto the hero right as he took off, being carried high in the air. It was terrifying but he was so badly needing an answer. Luckily, All Might seemed to take pity on him as he landed on a nearby rooftop. \"Well then,\" And Izuku was ashamed to hear the annoyance in his voice, \"I guess I have time to answer one question.\"\\n\\nIzuku nodded as he wracked his brain for how to ask. \"Is...Is it possible for...\" He muttered. The words lumped up in his throat and he swallowed hard trying to force it back down. Was he going to cry again? He hoped not.\\n\\n\"You\\'re going to have to speak up, my boy! I can\\'t hear you!\"\\n\\n\"Is it possible for someone without a quirk to be a hero?! Someone like me?\" Izuku asked desperately \"I have no powers but...could I ever hope to be someone like you?!\"\\n\\nAll Might asks, \"Without a quirk? The answer to your question is no.\" Izuku shrunk down to his knees on the rooftop. His heart continued sinking down and down. \"Hero is a dangerous job and most villains can\\'t be beaten without powers. You will be a liability. So no, I don\\'t think you could become a hero without a quirk. If you want to help other people, become a police officer. Or a medic. But leave the life-risking to the people with the durability to handle it.\"\\n\\nTears welled up in his eyes as he lost the final reason that helped him to hold on to life after everything.\\n\\n\"It\\'s okay to have dreams. Just make sure those dreams are attainable.\" All Might told him breaking him even more as he walked to the door on the building and headed inside.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\"Pray for a quirk in your next life...then take a swan dive off the roof of the building.\"\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBakugo\\'s words rang in Izuku\\'s ear and before he knew what he was doing, Izuku had his shoes kicked off sloppily and he was standing on the edge of the roof that All Might had so casually left him on after breaking his heart. His breath was shaky. \\n\\nHe had nothing to live for. Not without his dream. Even the police academy would expect him to have a quirk. He didn\\'t have except his dream that was his in the world.\\n\\nSo, The world has no place for him anymore.\\n\\nThe thought was unsettling. Scary even. But true... \\n\\nThere was no point in delaying the inevitable.\\n\\nClosing his eyes tightly, Izuku shifted his weight forward and felt his toes leave the edge of the roof and then his heels. He was felt wind rushing past him faster than ever. Faster than a roller coaster. It almost felt like he was flying. A small smile spread across his lips. Flying. That would be a fun quirk. Large wings spread out and flew through the air freely after a rebirth like Phoenix. That would be heroic. Maybe he would get a Phoenix quirk in his next life. He hoped.\\n\\nWith that thought he hit the ground and his vision faded.\\n\\nEnd of Chapter'"

up that easily he wanted to help people just like all might said and he would smile just like him he was only 4 years from ua university entrance exam  (i've got to work harder if i want to be able to get into ua as it is my only choice being quirkless) izuku thought as he walked to school from his home after finishing house chores since it was a payment to his mother for allowing him to live under a roof   he heard a fight breaking out and ran there instead to see who was fighting who's fighting he asked as he pushed his way to the front of the crowd from there he could see the rookie hero kamui woods fighting off against a giant shark-man on railroad tracks   at that moment kamui started to create more vine like tendrils of wood from his arm as he prepared his ultimate attack lacquered chain prison but before he could finish executing his super move a giant kicked the giant man followed by a loud voice canyon canon   a giant blonde haired lady shouted as she performed a flying kick on the giant villain she landed and turned her attention towards the public today is the day of my debut my name is mt lady a pleasure to make your ass-quaintance she said as she posed for the cameras that surrounded her  izuku started to take notes about what the new hero's quirk could possibly be the man next to him looked at him before speaking up hey wait you're take notes you wanna be a hero huh that's great good luck the man said giving a thumbs up to izuku who looked surprised for a second before smiling a genuine smile towards the man and thanking him for the words izuku went to his school  ==========================================================  izuku was sitting in his bench just watching the birds flying outside the window while his whole class was shouting and playing it was peaceful for izuku until his blonde haired teacher entered the classroom carrying a stack of papers with a serious expression  so as 3rd year students its time to think seriously about your future and what you want to do with your lives he said with a serious expression before he threw all the papers in the air with a smirk on his face  but why bother i know you all want to be heroes he said happily as the whole classroom except izuku and bakugo went uproar and the students started to show off their quirks  yes yes you've got some very impressive quirks but no quirk usage in school so get a hold of yourself  hey teach don't lump me and my gang in with this group of losers a voice said as everyone turned and found bakugo sitting in his bench with his legs on the table cockily i am not gonna be stuck with these rejects at the bottom he bragged as he smirked cockily  at that claim the whole class turned against him and shouted in outrage huh that's uncalled for katsuki  but bakugo just mocked them further more you all should shut up like the extras you are  the teacher silenced the class and started reading bakugo and other's results oh i see you want to go to ua university right bakugo  the whole class gasped except bakugo who smirked all were whispering about the shocking news and how it was impossible to join ua at the back of the classroom izuku just lied down already knowing where this was going and he likely was going to suffer more today  that's exactly why you guys are just extras bakugo said mockingly as he jumped on top of his bench and started bragging more   i aced the mock test i am the only one who could possibly get into ua from this school i'll be the one to surpass all might and become the top hero and my name will be inscribed in the list op top earners  bakugo shouted this as he raised his hand into a fist and laughed  the teacher soon read the next sheet and smirked planning something for fun  oh yeah midoriya you want to go to ua too right the teacher asked mockingly looking at izuku knowing the outcome full well the whole class became silent while bakugo froze after that sentence and izuku glared at his teacher for setting him up suddenly the whole class except bakugo laughed looking at izuku  huh midoriya no way  you can't get into the hero course just by studying  izuku was just sitting silently trying to calm himself until bakugo came and blasted his bench into two which made izuku getting launched into the back wall of the class  hey deku you're below the rejects you're quirkless bakugo shouted as small explosions popped in his hands  how can you even stand in the same ring as me bakugo shouted all the while izuku just sat at the ground with shadow covering his eyes  are you taking the test for fun what the hell can you do you're quirkless bakugo shouted as everyone joined her and glared at izuku  slowly the teacher silenced the class and proceeded with the homeroom while bakugo glared at izuku with hatred  ==========================================================  it was the end of the day and izuku was packing up his stuff he was about to grab his hero notebook when a hand grabbed it first and snatched it away izuku looked up and saw it was bakugo standing with his goons all glaring at him he mentally sighed fed up of dealing with them  we're not done talking yet deku bakugo said as all the three looked at his notebook you're still writing these stupid stalker notebooks  izuku just looked at them not wanting to deal with them just give it back  but bakugo just blasted the notebook and threw the notebook outside the window into a koi pond irritating izuku further more  there are many stories about top heroes from their school days and we want to be the only ones to be able to make into ua from this shitty school bakugo said as he raised his hands and burned izuku's shoulder which he didn't even flinch already got used to it he smiled a creepy smile and told in a sickly sweet voice about not applying to ua and many things which izuku tuned out already getting bored with the usual bullying those three went and izuku sighed as he took his bag but bakugo smirked and told him a thing which will soon change his life  if you wanna be a hero that badly there's a quick way to do it everyone look at him curiously and izuku just raised his eyebrow doubting anything good will come from that mouth of his  he continued believe that you'll be born with a quirk in your next life and take a last chance dive off the roof and walked off laughing with his goons not noticing how izuku froze  izuku's eyes went wide and his heart rate was rising rapidly he had already got death jokes and spider lilies before but he didn't think bakugo would sink so lowly izuku stood there frozen for some time with an emotionless look slowly calming himself and started to go to his home   ==========================================================  izuku walked towards a tunnel while a sludge was rising through a manhole near it izuku looked back and saw a huge sludge villain forming izuku started shaking after seeing the sludge villain again but stopped trying to maintain his composure  the villain spoke with a ugly smile on his face you'll make a perfect skin suit for me to hide in kid as izuku tried to run the villain captured him and started to go inside him through his mouth the villain told him not to fight back so it will be easier for both izuku struggle was slowing down due to lack of oxygen a blue streak appeared from the manhole and it's cover flew all might came out of the sewer and saved him   and just like that all might turned around and crouched down as if to jump away izuku saw his opportunity to ask something weighing on his mind slipping away and finally found his voice wait all might i- i have a question before you leave he shouted holding into the hem of his jacket nervously just one  what followed was the single worst decision izuku had ever made in his life grabbing onto the hero right as he took off being carried high in the air it was terrifying but he was so badly needing an answer luckily all might seemed to take pity on him as he landed on a nearby rooftop well then and izuku was ashamed to hear the annoyance in his voice i guess i have time to answer one question  izuku nodded as he wracked his brain for how to ask isis it possible for he muttered the words lumped up in his throat and he swallowed hard trying to force it back down was he going to cry again he hoped not  you're going to have to speak up my boy i can't hear you  is it possible for someone without a quirk to be a hero someone like me izuku asked desperately i have no powers butcould i ever hope to be someone like you  all might asks without a quirk the answer to your question is no izuku shrunk down to his knees on the rooftop his heart continued sinking down and down hero is a dangerous job and most villains can't be beaten without powers you will be a liability so no i don't think you could become a hero without a quirk if you want to help other people become a police officer or a medic but leave the life-risking to the people with the durability to handle it  tears welled up in his eyes as he lost the final reason that helped him to hold on to life after everything  it's okay to have dreams just make sure those dreams are attainable all might told him breaking him even more as he walked to the door on the building and headed inside  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  pray for a quirk in your next lifethen take a swan dive off the roof of the building  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  bakugo's words rang in izuku's ear and before he knew what he was doing izuku had his shoes kicked off sloppily and he was standing on the edge of the roof that all might had so casually left him on after breaking his heart his breath was shaky   he had nothing to live for not without his dream even the police academy would expect him to have a quirk he didn't have except his dream that was his in the world  so the world has no place for him anymore  the thought was unsettling scary even but true   there was no point in delaying the inevitable  closing his eyes tightly izuku shifted his weight forward and felt his toes leave the edge of the roof and then his heels he was felt wind rushing past him faster than ever faster than a roller coaster it almost felt like he was flying a small smile spread across his lips flying that would be a fun quirk large wings spread out and flew through the air freely after a rebirth like phoenix that would be heroic maybe he would get a phoenix quirk in his next life he hoped  with that thought he hit the ground and his vision faded  end of chapter\""

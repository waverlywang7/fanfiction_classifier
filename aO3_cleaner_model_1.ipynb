       "'Matthias can barely hear himself think with the blood pounding in his ears. He\\'d seen the anger in the young boy\\'s eyes, had seen the gun, but somehow, hadn\\'t expected to be shot.\\n\\t\\n\\nHe needs to get to Nina.\\n\\t\\n\\nAs he tries to navigate the streets of Ketterdam with a bullet wound, he remembers one of the conversations he\\'d first had with... well. His friends.\\n\\t\\n\\nWeeks ago, when they were working on the Ice Court mission. Jesper had made a comment about if they died, that he was going to make Wylan\\'s ghost teach him to play the flute so he could annoy Kaz for eternity.\\n\\t\\n\\nKaz had said he\\'d just hire Matthias\\'s ghost to kick Jesper\\'s ghost\\'s ass. \\n\\t\\n\\nMatthias had said his ghost wouldn\\'t associate with Kaz\\'s. \\n\\t\\n\\nHe\\'d felt so strange, making a joking comment with these people, people he thought were the worst kind of people. He\\'d felt like an idiot even saying anything in response.\\n\\t\\n\\nMatthias looks back at the Ice Court mission with a weird combination of bitterness and fondness. He\\'d hated being part of the team, hated being near Nina, hated interacting with Kaz, hated that he was going to be breaking into the Ice Court, the place he\\'d trained at, in his country, with the people he called his family.\\n\\t\\n\\nAnd somehow, since then... his definition of family has changed. \\n\\t\\n\\nMatthias\\'s family isn\\'t the druskelle anymore. His family isn\\'t the people who taught him to hate what he didn\\'t understand.\\n\\t\\n\\nHis family is the reckless boy who hides his Fabrikator powers, who is an excellent shot, who can make just about anybody laugh. \\n\\t\\n\\nHis family is the small girl who crosses the city using the rooftops more than she uses the streets, who names her weapons after her Saints, who cares so deeply about doing the right thing.\\n\\t\\n\\nHis family is the boy who can\\'t read, who willingly allowed himself to be transformed into someone else, who thinks the world can be better than it is.\\n\\t\\n\\nHis family is the boy he calls demjin, who pretends he only cares about profit, who hates admitting he has friends but who cares so deeply about them.\\n\\t\\n\\nHis family is the Heartrender who destroyed his worldview and helped him rebuild it, who is so confident in herself, who would burn the world down to keep the people she loves safe. His little red bird.\\n\\t\\n\\nMatthias\\'s family is a group of five people who he never thought he would even tolerate. People who make him smile.\\n\\t\\n\\nHe doesn\\'t want to leave them.\\n\\t\\n\\nThere\\'s so much he wants to, needs to, tell them. So much he wants to see.\\n\\t\\n\\nHe wants to see Jesper and Wylan get their shit together. He wants to tell Jesper that he isn\\'t a burden, wants to tell Wylan that he is enough. He wants to see Kaz let his guard down for Inej. He wants to tell Kaz that he\\'s not weak for caring about others, he wants to tell Inej she\\'s the strongest person he knows. He wants to see Nina get excited about waffles a thousand times over again. He wants to tell her she\\'s incredible. He wants to see the five of them happy, free. He wants to tell them he loves them.\\n\\t\\n\\nHe wants Jesper\\'s father to be safe, to go back to Novyi Zem and return to his life.\\n\\t\\n\\nHe wants Jesper to learn to accept and use his powers, to understand that he is more than his bad habits, because he is and he\\'s the only one who doesn\\'t see it.\\n\\t\\n\\nHe wants Inej to go off and save children from a fate like hers, to see the world and find her parents, to be as free as she wants to be.\\n\\t\\n\\nHe wants Wylan to hold his head high, to take control of his own life, and ignore what others say about him because his father\\'s voice has been in his head for far too long and he\\'s wrong.\\n\\t\\n\\nHe wants Kaz to let some of his barriers fall slightly, to make peace with what was taken from him, whatever that is and however he needs to do it.\\n\\t\\n\\nHe wants Nina to learn the extent of her new powers, to return to Ravka and do everything she\\'s ever wanted to do.\\n\\t\\n\\nHe wants them to be happy.\\n\\t\\n\\nBut more than that, Matthias wants to be there with them.\\n\\t\\n\\nHe was wrong when he said his ghost wouldn\\'t associate with theirs. Because here he is, making his way through Ketterdam to Nina, and he doesn\\'t want to leave them.\\n\\t\\n\\nHe wants to stay. He wants to return to Fjerda and make some changes, teach the other druskelle about Grisha. But mainly, he wants to stay with his family. \\n\\t\\n\\nHe can\\'t. No matter how much Matthias wants to stay, when Djel calls for somebody, they can\\'t argue. No matter how much he wants to stay alive, stay with his family, he can\\'t.\\n\\t\\n\\nBut he can get to Nina.\\n\\t\\n\\nSo that\\'s what he\\'ll do.\\n\\nWylan\\'s turn\\n\\nWylan\\'s in shock. Everything had gone... well, not well. He\\'s starting to wonder how the Dregs ever get anything done if all their plans go wrong. (But maybe it\\'s just his father who\\'d been messing with everything.)\\n\\t\\n\\nBut they\\'d adapted. Things went wrong, so they changed the plan and did what they could. And it had worked. \\n\\t\\n\\nThe auction had been a success. Kuwei had been \\'killed\\' by Jesper\\'s miracle shot, Wylan had gotten to see his father arrested, everything was looking good.\\n\\t\\n\\nBut Matthias is dead. And none of them know how he died.\\n\\t\\n\\nIt\\'s not fair. \\n\\t\\n\\n\\'We were all supposed to make it,\\' Wylan thinks, not for the first time since it happened. Because somewhere along the way, he\\'d begun thinking they were invincible. They\\'d gotten through everything this far, how could anything beat them?\\n\\t\\n\\nBut those were the ideas of a stupid kid. \\n\\t\\n\\nAnd Wylan wishes he could go back to being that kid, to believing that people were always kind and the good people always won and...\\n\\t\\n\\nOh.\\n\\t\\n\\nDo he and the rest of the Crows really count as good?\\n\\t\\n\\nHe\\'s not sure.\\n\\t\\n\\nHe wants to believe that\\'s the case.\\n\\t\\n\\nHe knows Inej has done awful things, has killed many people, but her entire goal in life is to make sure nobody else has to go through what she went through. \\n\\t\\n\\nAnd Nina has also done awful things, but she was a soldier. A child soldier. And she\\'s going to try to help the others whose minds have been poisoned.\\n\\t\\n\\nJesper is impulsive and reckless, but he\\'s always trying to make up for any and all mistakes he\\'s made. \\n\\t\\n\\nThat leaves Wylan and Kaz. And while once upon a time, Wylan would have tried to justify that he was good, he knows he\\'s not.\\n\\t\\n\\nOne doesn\\'t create bombs, use acids to melt things down, create something to ruin all the sugar in silos if they\\'re good. One doesn\\'t ruin their father\\'s life if they\\'re good.\\n\\t\\n\\nAnd Kaz... well. Wylan doesn\\'t know what has happened to Kaz, but he knows the older boy is not considered good by normal standards.\\n\\t\\n\\nIf Wylan thinks about it, none of the remaining Crows are good. They all do bad things, constantly, and not always out of necessity. \\n\\t\\n\\nBut by Wylan\\'s standards, they\\'re the best people he knows. And who cares about normal standards?\\n\\t\\n\\nBecause Inej is quiet and kind, always notices when one of her friends is upset, even when they think they\\'re hiding it, and goes to talk to them. And she isn\\'t always up for a hug, but that only makes it all the more special to get an Inej hug.\\n\\t\\n\\nAnd Nina hugs her friends close and claims she will never share food, but when one of her friends is upset, she\\'s passing them a toffee from her stash. And she sings loudly and badly and makes everyone smile.\\n\\t\\n\\nAnd Jesper is sweet and comforting and is so quick to cheer his friends up. And he makes them laugh and he tosses his arms around their shoulders as if it\\'s nothing and even when he\\'s poking fun at them, he\\'s doing it in a way where he points out their skills and talents. \\n\\t\\n\\nAnd Kaz is protective of his friends (because no matter what Kaz may think, Wylan knows Kaz has friends, even if he won\\'t admit it) and would do anything if it meant they\\'d be safe. And when he tells them they did something good, they know he means it. \\n\\t\\n\\nPlus, not even Dirtyhands himself thought Jan Van Eck would allow his son to be killed. Kaz might have had awful things happen to him, but he is not an awful person because of it.\\n\\t\\n\\nNone of them are.\\n\\t\\n\\nBut even if Wylan thinks the other four are good people, he knows Matthias is was the best of them.\\n\\t\\n\\nBy normal standards, Matthias was a deserter, a traitor. He betrayed his country and his family and became the enemy.\\n\\t\\n\\nBut Wylan knows the boy who tried to stop them from seeing the Grisha burned at the stake. He knows the boy who saved Kaz\\'s life, even as he said he should let the other boy die. He knows the boy who loved Nina more than anything, knows the boy who was a quiet source of comfort. Quiet and calm, steady.\\n\\t\\n\\nWylan knows the boy who would look over at him when Nina or Jesper was flirting with somebody (usually Matthias and Wylan, respectively) and roll his eyes, even when he couldn\\'t hide a smile. He knows the boy who always seemed to know when someone needed someone else to just be there, even if they didn\\'t speak.\\n\\t\\n\\nAnd now he\\'s gone.\\n\\nInej\\n\\n\\n          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)\\n          \\n\\nInej can\\'t sleep. Maybe it\\'s the overly comfortable bed in the overwhelmingly lavish room Wylan is letting her use. (He says the room is hers whenever she wants it, but it\\'s a strange thought.) Maybe it\\'s the silence of the streets outside. Maybe it\\'s the fact that they just completed a job.\\n\\t\\n\\nOr maybe it\\'s because of Matthias. \\n\\t\\n\\nThat\\'s probably the most likely reason why she can\\'t sleep.\\n\\t\\n\\nShe slips out of bed and crosses to the window, opening it wide to let the cool night air in. And then she perches on the windowsill, letting her feet dangle outside. \\n\\t\\n\\nIt\\'s not safe, she knows that. She knows people would tell her she could fall and die. But then, she\\'s more familiar with the rooftops of Ketterdam than with its streets and alleys. \\n\\t\\n\\nBesides, odd as it sounds, being on rooftops or windowsills or tightropes has always been able to keep her grounded. It lets her think, make sense of what\\'s going on.\\n\\t\\n\\nAnd Inej really needs that right now.\\n\\t\\n\\nBecause Matthias is gone. She watched him die. And she couldn\\'t do anything.\\n\\t\\n\\nShe hadn\\'t expected to care for him at all. The way he acted, the way he treated Nina, not to mention the fact that he was a druskelle, nothing about him made him seem like someone Inej wanted to be around.\\n\\t\\n\\nAnd then throughout the job... somehow she\\'d learned to see past some of those things. Or at least understand why he was the way he was.\\n\\t\\n\\nHis devotion to Djel was something she could respect. His loyalty to his country and his strong morals, although not super helpful to the job, were also admirable. And his love for the family he lost was something she understood all too well. \\n\\t\\n\\nHe had protested when Nina took jurda parem, had cared for her through the withdrawal, had taken every shout and insult she leveled at him unflinchingly. (Maybe he thought he deserved it, she wasn\\'t sure.)\\n\\t\\n\\nAnd then when she was finally reunited with the rest of the Crows, she could see how different Matthias was from the angry boy she\\'d helped break out of prison.\\n\\t\\n\\nInej blinks away the tears springing to her eyes. \\n\\t\\n\\nIt\\'s not fair.\\n\\t\\n\\nShe trusts the saints with every fiber of her being, but sometimes... sometimes she doesn\\'t understand.\\n\\t\\n\\nShe didn\\'t understand when she was taken from her family. She didn\\'t understand when she was forced to work at the Menagerie. She still doesn\\'t understand it.\\n\\t\\n\\nAnd she definitely doesn\\'t understand why Matthias is gone. \\n\\t\\n\\nShe remembers whispers from family members when someone died. \"Only the good die young.\"\\n\\t\\n\\nMatthias had his flaws, but he was good. While dying, he begged Nina to help the other druskelle, to help them see the error of their ways. He tried his best to help the rest of the Crows whenever he could.\\n\\t\\n\\nBut Inej wishes he was still here.\\n\\t\\n\\nBut she\\'s trusted her saints this far, she has to trust that they know what they\\'re doing.\\n\\t\\n\\nAnd Inej will pray that Matthias is with his god. That he is in a better place, even though it\\'s far away.\\n\\t\\n\\nBecause she and Matthias both knew there was something beyond this life. And she knows Matthias will find it.\\n\\t\\n\\nShe\\'ll miss him. She knows Nina, Wylan, Jesper, and Kaz will too. \\n\\t\\n\\nThey\\'ve created their own family now. A Grisha who can raise the dead, a demo expert who can\\'t read, a sharpshooter with a gambling problem, the ruthless leader of the Dregs, a Wraith who\\'s done awful things, and a soldier who betrayed his country.\\n\\t\\n\\nMatthias will always be one of them. \\n\\t\\n\\nThey\\'ve all changed so much over the course of one job. (One job that went on for too long because Jan Van Eck tried to cross Kaz Brekker.) They\\'re all trying.\\n\\t\\n\\nKaz seems to think he\\'s trying for Inej, but she hopes he\\'s also trying for himself. That he\\'s trying to take his armor off and let people in because he wants to, not because he feels he has to. (Although Inej doesn\\'t hate the idea that Kaz is doing it for her. She actually quite likes it.)\\n\\t\\n\\nJesper is trying to be a better person, someone his father can be proud of. Inej knows it\\'s not going to be easy for him, but she\\'ll be there to support him because that\\'s what friends do. And he seems anxious about it, but Inej knows he can do anything if he puts his mind to it.\\n\\t\\n\\nWylan is trying to be better for himself. He\\'s trying to ask for what he wants, not just needs. (Although he\\'s not great at asking for what he needs, either.) Inej knows he\\'ll have Jesper with him every step of the way, and she knows that Kaz, Nina, and herself will be there, too, even if not always physically present. \\n\\t\\n\\nNina is trying to help the other druskelle. And by extension, trying to atone for all she\\'s done. Inej is terrified for her, but Nina is insistent. And Inej admires that. Even if it means it\\'ll be years before she sees Nina again, Inej knows that if anybody could do it, it would be Nina. \\n\\t\\n\\nAnd Inej... well. She\\'s going to get a boat and she\\'s going to find her parents. And then, she\\'ll hunt down slavers and everyone responsible for ruining lives the way they ruined hers, and she\\'ll kill them. She\\'s not a good person, that much is clear, but if she can stop even one little girl from going through what she went through... it\\'ll all be worth it.\\n\\t\\n\\nShe only wishes Matthias had a chance to continue trying. But he already changed for the better. Just being with Nina managed to change his perspective, change what he believed in. \\n\\t\\n\\nInej dries her eyes and steps back inside the room, closing the window and getting back into bed.\\n\\t\\n\\nShe\\'ll see him again. They all will. But not for some time.\\n\\t\\n\\nAnd although she wants to see him soon, she hopes it\\'s not for years to come, that the rest of them may still live and accomplish more, be better than they have been.\\n\\t\\n\\nThe saints will take care of the rest.\\n\\nNot really sure how I feel about this one, but hope you like it anyway!'"

       "'\\n\\nKaz was sitting under the tree in the backyard when Jordie and Jesper came running over. Jesper was staying for the weekend and their Da was busy, meaning Jordie was in charge. Normally taking care of Kaz was easy, but he and Jesper seemed to always see everything as a challenge, which is probably why, Jordie assumed, Kaz was injured.\\n\\n\"Hi Jordie.\" Kaz said waving at him.\\n\\n\"No, not \\'Hi Jordie\\' your injured. You climbed the tree again, didn\\'t you?\" Jordie asked and shook his head.\\n\\n\"Yeah, but I didn\\'t know the branch would break.\" Kaz said as Jordie inspected him for anything major.\\n\\n\"Well, your legs and left arm are fine.\"\\n\\n\"My left arm? What about-\"\\n\\n\"Your wrist is broken on the right.\"\\n\\nKaz\\'s eyes grew wide and Jordie realized his mistake. Kaz was only seven and the idea of a broken bone seemed terrifying.\\n\\n\"Hey, but it\\'s alright. I will get a doctor from town and Jesper will help you have lunch.\"\\n\\nJesper chimed in now. \"I will?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you will.\" Jordie said through gritted teeth and Jesper nodded in agreement, afraid of what might happen if he refused.\\n\\nAfter he made sure Jesper and Kaz were inside and that Kaz was in a position that he could eat without hurting his wrist he went into town. The ride didn\\'t take long on horse, nor did finding a doctor, but something was off about his journey. He told himself he was just paranoid as he led the doctor towards home. He looked at the mountains as he road, watching as the clouds passed by, but the clouds weren\\'t moving, the mountains were.\\n\\n\"Did you see that?\" He asked in disbelief\\n\\n\"See what?\" The doctor asked.\\n\\n\"The mountains, they-they.\" Jordie stopped talking and laughed. \"Mountains don\\'t move!\"\\n\\n\"No they don\\'t.\" The doctor said looking confused.\\n\\nJordie howled. \"Mountains don\\'t move, KAZ!\"\\n\\nJordie panicked as he trampled his little brother. \\n\\nHe cried as he stopped the horse and ran to his little brother, dead. \\n\\n\"Help him! Help him please!\" He cried as he held his little brother in his arms.\\n\\n\"No.\" The doctor said from behind him.\\n\\n\"No? What do you mean no? Isn\\'t that your job.\" Jordie whisked his head around only to see Jakkob Heterozoon, the man that had scammed him out of his money. The man the killed his brother.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you see Jordie?\" Heterozoon spat as he drew out a knife. \"This was the plan all along.\"\\n\\nJordie woke up crying. It had been seven years since Hetrozoon had scammed him and his brother had died. He didn\\'t know why he\\'d dream\\'t of trampling Kaz, most of his dreams were like that though. They were wonderful until Kaz died and Hetrozoon appeared. Nicole looked up from the book she was reading across the room. \\n\\n\"Dreaming about Kaz again?\" She asked and walked over to the couch.\\n\\nJordie nodded.\\n\\nNicole sighed. \"If anyone was strong enough to survive it was him. You used to always say that. You used to always say you\\'d find him. What changed?\"\\n\\n\"I tried to find him, but I have to face it, he\\'s gone. even if was alive when they took him he\\'s gone now and it\\'s my fault.\"\\n\\n\"No. They didn\\'t check his pulse, you were scammed. You were trying to get Kaz some medicine for his throat. You did nothing wrong.\"\\n\\n\"I got scammed first thing Nicole. I told him I was smart, that I\\'d protect him. I lied.\"\\n\\n\"You did your best.\"\\n\\n\"My best wasn\\'t good enough.\"\\n\\nNicole looked at him with sad eyes. He hated her seeing him like this, but his brother seemed to haunt him, like he didn\\'t want to be forgotten.\\n\\n\"I hear his voice in my head still.\" Jordie said, a tear sliding down his cheek.\\n\\n\"What does he say.\" Nicole asked, trying to help in anyway possible. \\n\\n\"Things he said when he was alive. \\'You burnt the toast. How did you burn the toast?\\' or, \\'The market is the other way, idiot.\\'\" Jordie laughed. No matter what Kaz would always be Kaz.\\n\\nNicole smiled. \"That sounds like Kaz.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, he also tells me to let him talk to Leonus by having me the mediator.\"\\n\\n\"Oh? and why would he ask about that?\"\\n\\n\"Kaz will always be Kaz.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a reason in itself.\" They laughed and told stories about their youth when Nicole spent time with Jordie and Kaz spent time with Leonus. Two families that would never be the same again. \\n\\nLeonus came in around seven with a newspaper. He seemed to happy.\\n\\n\"What does it say Leo?\" Nicole asked as she turned to her jumpy brother.\\n\\n\"Jordie was right!\"\\n\\nNicole and Jordie shared a confused look.\\n\\n\"The headline! The headline!\" Leonus chanted.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the headline?\" Jordie asked, growing currious.\\n\\nLeonus cleared his throat. \" \\'Kaz Brekker, the famous Bastard of the Barrel, Dirtyhands, and leader of the Dregs, now nod only owns Fifth Harbor, but Fourth and Third as well.\\' \"\\n\\n\"Why does that make me right?\" Jordie asked.\\n\\n\"How many Kaz\\'s do you know? Also doesn\\'t the name \\'Brekker\\' remind you of the old boating equipment Kaz used to take apart to see how it ran?\"\\n\\nThe realization hit Jordie like a bomb. \\n\\n\"Nicole, Leonus, who wants to go on a road trip?\"\\n\\nThis is a chapter from Kaz\\'s POV and it takes place the same time as the last chapter\\n\\n\\n          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\nKaz had never been tempted to kill Wylan before, but if he didn\\'t get away from Wylan soon, he might. Wylan was lecturing Kaz about etiquette and how to eat properly. He was having a guest over the next day and Jesper wanted Kaz to come. Kaz, however, did not want to go. He didn\\'t even know who the guest was. Jesper claimed it was a surprise and that he needed to be there, so eventually, Kaz agreed. \\n\\n\"No! That\\'s your soup spoon!\" Wylan cried out as he watched Kaz eat.\\n\\n\"A spoon is a spoon Wylan. It doesn\\'t matter what it\\'s used for!\" Kaz snapped and continued eating.\\n\\n\"Alright, alright. I think that\\'s enough for today.\" Jesper sighed.\\n\\n\"The dinner is tomorrow Jes.\" Wylan groaned.\\n\\n\"I know, I know. We\\'ll figure something out.\" Jesper huffed.\\n\\nJust then Pim ran in and started talking about a boat delivering rare spices. \\n\\n\"There\\'s a boat called the Star-half! I saw it myself. It\\'s a fancy boat and it\\'s delivering spices that I almost never see!\"\\n\\nKaz nodded. \"What kind?\"\\n\\n\"Nutmeg, rosemary, and danger-root!\" Pim exclaimed.\\n\\n\"Danger-root?\" Jesper chimed in now.\\n\\nKaz rolled his eyes. Of course Jesper would be interested in the danger-root. It tasted amazing and made you forget your worries, but it caused hallucinations of your worst fears. Only the bravest of brave dared to eat it. Kaz remembered Jordie eating some. Their dad had a small patch of land where he grew it. Jordie was ten at the time and Kaz was six. Jordie and his friend Xander were messing around when Xander dared Jordie to eat some. At first Jordie refused, but after a while of listening to Xander calling him a chicken he ate some. Jordie never told Kaz what he saw, and he stopped talking to Xander. Xander got fed up with Jordie\\'s silence and made a \\'peace offering\\'. He baked cookies and put them on the front porch. Kaz was seven now and he thought his dad had made them. Unknown to him, there was danger-root in the cookies. He saw everything he loved get destroyed. He watched his family abandon him. He suffered. He hadn\\'t been able to sleep on his own for a month after. He always slept with Jordie or his Da. \\n\\n\"You\\'re not having any.\" Kaz said.\\n\\n\"Ouch, shut down first thing.\" Jesper said and laughed.\\n\\n\"Where is this ship?\" Kaz asked, turning his attention back to Pim.\\n\\n\"Fourth harbor.\"\\n\\n\"Well, what are we waiting for?\" Jesper asked. \"It\\'s time for a heist.\"\\n\\nThe heist was going as planned. Wylan and Kaz had gotten on board the boat and Jesper was sitting on the dock behind some creates, just in case things went wrong. Pim stood on the docks, disguised as a worker, waiting for Kaz and Wylan to deliver the creates. Kaz and Wylan had already gotten three on the docks and onto another boat of their own. Eventually all the Nutmeg had been moved and they started on the Rosemary when they heard someone coming. They dove behind the creates and sat in silence. \\n\\n\"Come on, we have to get these kids off the boat before someone catches us.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, and by someone you mean the \\'Ghost-Ship\\'.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah. Come on.\"\\n\\nKaz peeked over the creates. The \\'Ghost Ship\\' is what some called the Wrath, meaning that these people were slavers. That\\'s when everything went wrong. Kaz watched numerous kids get taken away, none that he knew, or at least not until the last few.\\n\\nThe last few were from Lij, kids he knew when he was growing up. Sage, Ginger, and Lavender. His old friends, his old classmates. \\n\\n\"Kaz, they\\'re gone.\"\\n\\n\"I know. Keep moving creates, I\\'ll be right back.\"\\n\\n\"Where are you going?\" Wylan asked.\\n\\n\"Sage.\" Kaz replied before following the slavers.\\n\\nKaz and Sage had been great friends. Sage was Kaz\\'s second best friend, after Leonus. Sage had looked up to Kaz as he was two months older and much more adventurous. Although Kaz wanted no connections to his past, he couldn\\'t just let an old friend die. He found them in a room, the slavers and Sage were having an argument.\\n\\n\"Sit down!\" One of the slavers demanded\\n\\n\"You\\'re in my spot.\" Sage replied.\\n\\n\"Excuse me?\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re in my spot. Everyone knows that the smartest person in the room belongs in the center.\"\\n\\nGinger laughed. \"Then it should be Lavender!\"\\n\\nSage thought for a second then nodded. \"Yeah, that\\'s true.\"\\n\\nKaz smirked. Lavender was the second \\'best\\' kid at the school. She was fast enough, smart enough, and brave enough to be, but Kaz always won. He was faster, smarter, and braver, or so he had been told. He didn\\'t actually care, sure he had been competitive as a child, but he wasn\\'t a sore loser. \\n\\nLavender shook her head. \"No. I\\'m not smart, otherwise I wouldn\\'t be here.\"\\n\\n\"The only way you wouldn\\'t be here is if you were Kaz-smart.\" Sage said and rolled his eyes.\\n\\nThis caught attention of the slavers. \"Kaz-smart?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, an old friend of ours was named Kaz. He was a genius! Everyone says he died of the plague, but there\\'s no way that\\'s true. If anyone survived it was him! He\\'s probably the king of the city now!\" Sage bragged.\\n\\nThe slavers shared nervous glances.\\n\\n\"What?\" Sage asked. \"Kaz and Jordan were here and Kaz was supposed to be dead. Jordan left and was sad, but never stopped looking for Kaz, if anyone survived it was Kaz.\"\\n\\nKaz smirked. Sage knew him so well, it bothered him.\\n\\n\"Does this uh, this Kaz have a last name?\" A slaver asked quietly.\\n\\n\"Uh, I sure hope he does.\"\\n\\n\"What is it?\"\\n\\n\"I said he has a last name,\" Sage said and rolled his eyes, \"not that I\\'d tell you it.\"\\n\\nKaz took that as his cue and attacked the slavers. After taking out two of them Sage, Ginger, and Lavender got the idea. With the help it didn\\'t take long to knock the slavers unconscious.\\n\\nKaz stood over a slaver, looking down at it, he only turned his head when he heard a voice.\\n\\n\"Well, well, well. Look who decided to join the party.\" Sage laughed.\\n\\n\"Someone smart, someone brave, someone daring.\" Ginger teased.\\n\\n\"The one, the only, KAZIRMEAR!\" Lavender hollered. \\n\\n\"Kazirmear?\" An all too familiar voice said.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t even think about calling me that Wylan.\"\\n\\nWylan smirked. \"Hello everyone, I am Wylan. Kazirmear and I were stea- moving spices when he saw you. He didn\\'t give me an explanation why he followed you, he just said,\\'Sage.\\' Does that mean anything to any of you?\"\\n\\nSage smirked. \"Sage Exel at your service!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you\\'re a person. Why did Kazirmear say your name?\"\\n\\nKaz shot Wylan a death glare that only made Wylan smile more.\\n\\n\"Probably \\'cause we were friends when we were kids.\" Sage said and shugged.\\n\\n\"KAZ HAD FRIENDS???\"\\n\\nSage, Ginger, and Lavender, looked hurt.\\n\\n\"Yes! Sage, Ginger, and I were Kaz\\'s friends! He didn\\'t tell you about us?\"\\n\\n\"No, but I can\\'t wait to hear all about it.\" Wylan said and walked away beckoning for the eight children in the room to follow.\\n\\nThey did.\\n\\nKaz asked Wylan about the other kids and was told they were safe and he had people looking for their families. Kaz nodded.\\n\\n\"Sage, Ginger, and Lavender. I can get them home, so don\\'t worry about it.\"\\n\\nWylan raised an eyebrow, but nodded. \\n\\nThen there was a gunshot.\\n\\nI hope you\\'re enjoying this, please feel free to leave comments about my work so that I can see what I need to improve.\\n\\nThis is gonna be... different\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Sage! Sage! Sage! Sage!\" Jesper and Wylan chanted as Sage chugged a bottle of grape juice.\\n\\n\"Done! Lavender what\\'s my time?\" Sage hollered as he slammed the bottle done.\\n\\n\"One minute twenty-three seconds.\" Lavender responded from the counter where she sat.\\n\\n\"Dang it!\" Sage moaned.\\n\\n\"What that\\'s really good.\" Jesper remarked confusedly.\\n\\n\"I still can\\'t beat Kaz\\'s record.\"\\n\\nWylan choked on his drink. \"Kazirmear\\'s record?\"\\n\\nKaz growled at Wylan who laughed in return.\\n\\n\"Yeah! Kaz can drink an entire bottle in thirty-seven seconds!\" Sage bragged.\\n\\n\"He can? I\\'ve never seen him chug anything.\" Jesper pouted.\\n\\n\"Never will.\" Kaz replied.\\n\\n\"Sure he will, if we can get Jordie to compete with you.\" Ginger laughed.\\n\\nKaz growled. \"He\\'s dead, I saw his dead corpse in the-\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s alive! He\\'s livin\\' with his wife and Leonus!\"\\n\\n\"Why would Leonus be there?\"\\n\\n\"He married Nicole.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, that checks out.\"\\n\\n\"Nicole, Leonus, Jordie, who are these people?\" Jesper asked.\\n\\nKaz sent Ginger and Lavender a warning glance, but Sage was already talking when Kaz turned to give him the same warning.\\n\\n\"Leonus is Kazirmear\\'s,\" That name again, \"Best friend. Nicole is Leonus\\'s sister and Jordie- who\\'s real name is Jordan- Is Kaz\\'s br-\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s nobody.\" Kaz interupted.\\n\\n\"Come on Kaz.\" Lavender sighed.\\n\\n\"Yeah you can\\'t cut people out of your life especially not your brother.\" Ginger finished.\\n\\nSilence filled the room and Kaz\\'s old friend\\'s realized their mistake.\\n\\n\"They didn\\'t know?\" Sage asked.\\n\\n\"Sage- No.\"\\n\\nJordie was nervous. It\\'d been years since, the incident, and he was afriad of what he\\'d find. Kaz Brekker was a gang leader, and feared, and cruel. Nothing like his little brother, yet he was. \\n\\n\"What is he tries to hurt you?\" Leonus rambled as they walked the streets of Ketterdam.\\n\\n\"He-he won\\'t.\" Jordie murmured, looking for the Slat, the area where Kaz Brekker lives.\\n\\nThey finally arrived only to find that Jordie and Kaz look insanely alike, causing everyone to believe they\\'re the same person.\\n\\n\"Just roll with it.\" Leonus whispered.\\n\\n\"Um...\"\\n\\nJordie rolls with it, Kaz doesn\\'t\\n\\nThis might suck, sorry if it does. ANywaY HavE FuN!\\n\\n\\n            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Kaz!\" Shouted a man who was clearly drunk.\\n\\n\"Brekker, I have my report ready.\" Said another.\\n\\n\"Brekker, who are these people, are they joining the gang.\"\\n\\n\"Brekker, what happened to your tattoo.\"\\n\\nJordie was confused, also concerned.\\n\\n\"Just roll with it.\" Leonus laughs.\\n\\n\"You are not getting a tattoo.\" Jordie hissed in response. \\n\\n\"Brekker?\" Asked a girl.\\n\\n\"Um, well I was just getting a drink.\" Jordie said trying to act like Kaz.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll bring one to you, would your guests like some as well or...\" The girl trailed off.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll take one!\" Leonus chimed in.\\n\\n\"You most certainly will not.\"\\n\\n\"Come on.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s right Leo.\" Nicole scolded.\\n\\n\"She can have one.\" Jordie nodded and started upstairs, listening to the whispers.\\n\\n\"Did Brekker get a girlfriend?\" One asked.\\n\\n\"No he\\'s probably just luring them in before he kills them.\" Another responded.\\n\\n\"Maybe she wants a job?\"\\n\\n\"Maybe he bought her?\"\\n\\n\"Maybe\"\\n\\n\"Maybe\"\\n\\n\"Maybe\"\\n\\nJordie climbed the stairs as fast as possible, leaving people baffled.\\n\\n\"Sorry Kaz.\" Ginger apologized.\\n\\n\"We didn\\'t know...\" Lavender sighed.\\n\\n\"It\\'s Ginger\\'s fault...\" Sage said and stepped out on the way of a kitchen knife that hit the wall next to him.\\n\\n\"YOU HAVE A BROTHER?\" Jesper screamed.\\n\\n\"Had.\" Kaz corrected.\\n\\n\"He\\'s still alive Kaz.\" Sage muttered.\\n\\n\"He\\'s in denial, Sage.\" Wylan said.\\n\\nKaz rolled his eyes. \"I\\'m headed back to the slat.\"\\n\\nThe others followed.\\n\\nWhen Kaz arrived everyone seemed confused, some even mentioned never seeing him leave.\\n\\nKaz shrugged off the strange feeling that some thing was wrong, then chaos ensued.\\n\\nAfter a while Jordie and Nicole got fed up with waiting for the real Kaz to arrive and gathered there things to leave. They were interrupted by a knock on the door.\\n\\n\"Boss? Aren\\'t you supposed to be at the Van Eck\\'s right now?\" A boy asked as he handed him another drink.\\n\\nJordie thought for a moment before remembering something about the Van Eck manor and where it was. He nodded.\\n\\n\"I should get going.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah you-\"\\n\\nJordie was already sprinting for the stairs.\\n\\n\"Sir. Your cane!\"\\n\\nJordie jumped on the banister and slid down the staircase, surprising everyone he passed. When he jumped off he landed right on top of someone, Kaz.\\n\\nAs soon as the person hit him Kaz reacted, swinging his cane into their ribs, or arm, or leg, he wasn\\'t actually sure.\\n\\n\"Stop, Kaz, wait, STOP!\" The person screamed, their voice sounded familiar, and everyone was erupting into arguments around them, but Kaz didn\\'t stop.\\n\\nThe person was bleeding now, but Kaz didn\\'t care, they\\'d jumped on him. You don\\'t jump on Kaz Brekker. His thoughts were interrupted by a shout.\\n\\n\"KAZIRMEAR DANGER RIETVELD STOP HITTING JORDAN RIGHT NOW!\"\\n\\nKaz came out of his trance to see Jordie bleeding on the floor and a woman at the top of the stairs.\\n\\n\"What did you just call me?\"\\n\\n\"It doesn\\'t matter, I told you to stop and what I say goes.\" That\\'s when Kaz recognized her, Nicole. Jordie\\'s wife.\\n\\nJesper was quick to jump in. \"Let\\'s all go back to Wylan\\'s, we can finish this, whatever this is, there, ok?\"\\n\\nJordie was the first to nod. Kaz was the first to leave.\\n\\nHope you enjoyed it, if you read this please leave a comment about what I can do better.'"

Leonus came in around seven with a newspaper. He seemed to happy.  What does it say Leo? Nicole asked as she turned to her jumpy brother.  Jordie was right!  Nicole and Jordie shared a confused look.  The headline! The headline! Leonus chanted.  What's the headline? Jordie asked, growing currious.  Leonus cleared his throat.  'Kaz Brekker, the famous Bastard of the Barrel, Dirtyhands, and leader of the Dregs, now nod only owns Fifth Harbor, but Fourth and Third as well.'   Why does that make me right? Jordie asked.  How many Kaz's do you know? Also doesn't the name 'Brekker' remind you of the old boating equipment Kaz used to take apart to see how it ran?  The realization hit Jordie like a bomb.   Nicole, Leonus, who wants to go on a road trip?  This is a chapter from Kaz's POV and it takes place the same time as the last chapter    (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)      Kaz had never been tempted to kill Wylan before, but if he didn't get away from Wylan soon, he might. Wylan was lecturing Kaz about etiquette and how to eat properly. He was having a guest over the next day and Jesper wanted Kaz to come. Kaz, however, did not want to go. He didn't even know who the guest was. Jesper claimed it was a surprise and that he needed to be there, so eventually, Kaz agreed.   No! That's your soup spoon! Wylan cried out as he watched Kaz eat.  A spoon is a spoon Wylan. It doesn't matter what it's used for! Kaz snapped and continued eating.  Alright, alright. I think that's enough for today. Jesper sighed.  The dinner is tomorrow Jes. Wylan groaned.  I know, I know. We'll figure something out. Jesper huffed.  Just then Pim ran in and started talking about a boat delivering rare spices.   There's a boat called the Star-half! I saw it myself. It's a fancy boat and it's delivering spices that I almost never see!  Kaz nodded. What kind?  Nutmeg, rosemary, and danger-root! Pim exclaimed.  Danger-root? Jesper chimed in now.  Kaz rolled his eyes. Of course Jesper would be interested in the danger-root. It tasted amazing and made you forget your worries, but it caused hallucinations of your worst fears. Only the bravest of brave dared to eat it. Kaz remembered Jordie eating some. Their dad had a small patch of land where he grew it. Jordie was ten at the time and Kaz was six. Jordie and his friend Xander were messing around when Xander dared Jordie to eat some. At first Jordie refused, but after a while of listening to Xander calling him a chicken he ate some. Jordie never told Kaz what he saw, and he stopped talking to Xander. Xander got fed up with Jordie's silence and made a 'peace offering'. He baked cookies and put them on the front porch. Kaz was seven now and he thought his dad had made them. Unknown to him, there was danger-root in the cookies. He saw everything he loved get destroyed. He watched his family abandon him. He suffered. He hadn't been able to sleep on his own for a month after. He always slept with Jordie or his Da.   You're not having any. Kaz said.  Ouch, shut down first thing. Jesper said and laughed.  Where is this ship? Kaz asked, turning his attention back to Pim.  Fourth harbor.  Well, what are we waiting for? Jesper asked. It's time for a heist.  The heist was going as planned. Wylan and Kaz had gotten on board the boat and Jesper was sitting on the dock behind some creates, just in case things went wrong. Pim stood on the docks, disguised as a worker, waiting for Kaz and Wylan to deliver the creates. Kaz and Wylan had already gotten three on the docks and onto another boat of their own. Eventually all the Nutmeg had been moved and they started on the Rosemary when they heard someone coming. They dove behind the creates and sat in silence.   Come on, we have to get these kids off the boat before someone catches us.  Yeah, and by someone you mean the 'Ghost-Ship'.  Yeah. Come on.  Kaz peeked over the creates. The 'Ghost Ship' is what some called the Wrath, meaning that these people were slavers. That's when everything went wrong. Kaz watched numerous kids get taken away, none that he knew, or at least not until the last few.  The last few were from Lij, kids he knew when he was growing up. Sage, Ginger, and Lavender. His old friends, his old classmates.   Kaz, they're gone.  I know. Keep moving creates, I'll be right back.  Where are you going? Wylan asked.  Sage. Kaz replied before following the slavers.  Kaz and Sage had been great friends. Sage was Kaz's second best friend, after Leonus. Sage had looked up to Kaz as he was two months older and much more adventurous. Although Kaz wanted no connections to his past, he couldn't just let an old friend die. He found them in a room, the slavers and Sage were having an argument.  Sit down! One of the slavers demanded  You're in my spot. Sage replied.  Excuse me?  You're in my spot. Everyone knows that the smartest person in the room belongs in the center.  Ginger laughed. Then it should be Lavender!  Sage thought for a second then nodded. Yeah, that's true.  Kaz smirked. Lavender was the second 'best' kid at the school. She was fast enough, smart enough, and brave enough to be, but Kaz always won. He was faster, smarter, and braver, or so he had been told. He didn't actually care, sure he had been competitive as a child, but he wasn't a sore loser.   Lavender shook her head. No. I'm not smart, otherwise I wouldn't be here.  The only way you wouldn't be here is if you were Kaz-smart. Sage said and rolled his eyes.  This caught attention of the slavers. Kaz-smart?  Yeah, an old friend of ours was named Kaz. He was a genius! Everyone says he died of the plague, but there's no way that's true. If anyone survived it was him! He's probably the king of the city now! Sage bragged.  The slavers shared nervous glances.  What? Sage asked. Kaz and Jordan were here and Kaz was supposed to be dead. Jordan left and was sad, but never stopped looking for Kaz, if anyone survived it was Kaz.  Kaz smirked. Sage knew him so well, it bothered him.  Does this uh, this Kaz have a last name? A slaver asked quietly.  Uh, I sure hope he does.  What is it?  I said he has a last name, Sage said and rolled his eyes, not that I'd tell you it.  Kaz took that as his cue and attacked the slavers. After taking out two of them Sage, Ginger, and Lavender got the idea. With the help it didn't take long to knock the slavers unconscious.  Kaz stood over a slaver, looking down at it, he only turned his head when he heard a voice.  Well, well, well. Look who decided to join the party. Sage laughed.  Someone smart, someone brave, someone daring. Ginger teased.  The one, the only, KAZIRMEAR! Lavender hollered.   Kazirmear? An all too familiar voice said.  Don't even think about calling me that Wylan.  Wylan smirked. Hello everyone, I am Wylan. Kazirmear and I were stea- moving spices when he saw you. He didn't give me an explanation why he followed you, he just said,'Sage.' Does that mean anything to any of you?  Sage smirked. Sage Exel at your service!  Oh, you're a person. Why did Kazirmear say your name?  Kaz shot Wylan a death glare that only made Wylan smile more.  Probably 'cause we were friends when we were kids. Sage said and shugged.  KAZ HAD FRIENDS???  Sage, Ginger, and Lavender, looked hurt.  Yes! Sage, Ginger, and I were Kaz's friends! He didn't tell you about us?  No, but I can't wait to hear all about it. Wylan said and walked away beckoning for the eight children in the room to follow.  They did.  Kaz asked Wylan about the other kids and was told they were safe and he had people looking for their families. Kaz nodded.  Sage, Ginger, and Lavender. I can get them home, so don't worry about it.  Wylan raised an eyebrow, but nodded.   Then there was a gunshot.  I hope you're enjoying this, please feel free to leave comments about my work so that I can see what I need to improve.  This is gonna be... different Sage! Sage! Sage! Sage! Jesper and Wylan chanted as Sage chugged a bottle of grape juice.  Done! Lavender what's my time? Sage hollered as he slammed the bottle done.  One minute twenty-three seconds. Lavender responded from the counter where she sat.  Dang it! Sage moaned.  What that's really good. Jesper remarked confusedly.  I still can't beat Kaz's record.  Wylan choked on his drink. Kazirmear's record?  Kaz growled at Wylan who laughed in return.  Yeah! Kaz can drink an entire bottle in thirty-seven seconds! Sage bragged.  He can? I've never seen him chug anything. Jesper pouted.  Never will. Kaz replied.  Sure he will, if we can get Jordie to compete with you. Ginger laughed.  Kaz growled. He's dead, I saw his dead corpse in the-  He's alive! He's livin' with his wife and Leonus!  Why would Leonus be there?  He married Nicole.  Ah, that checks out.  Nicole, Leonus, Jordie, who are these people? Jesper asked.  Kaz sent Ginger and Lavender a warning glance, but Sage was already talking when Kaz turned to give him the same warning.  Leonus is Kazirmear's, That name again, Best friend. Nicole is Leonus's sister and Jordie- who's real name is Jordan- Is Kaz's br-  He's nobody. Kaz interupted.  Come on Kaz. Lavender sighed.  Yeah you can't cut people out of your life especially not your brother. Ginger finished.  Silence filled the room and Kaz's old friend's realized their mistake.  They didn't know? Sage asked.  Sage- No.  Jordie was nervous. It'd been years since, the incident, and he was afriad of what he'd find. Kaz Brekker was a gang leader, and feared, and cruel. Nothing like his little brother, yet he was.   What is he tries to hurt you? Leonus rambled as they walked the streets of Ketterdam.  He-he won't. Jordie murmured, looking for the Slat, the area where Kaz Brekker lives.  They finally arrived only to find that Jordie and Kaz look insanely alike, causing everyone to believe they're the same person.  Just roll with it. Leonus whispered.  Um...  Jordie rolls with it, Kaz doesn't  This might suck, sorry if it does. ANywaY HavE FuN!      (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)     Kaz! Shouted a man who was clearly drunk.  Brekker, I have my report ready. Said another.  Brekker, who are these people, are they joining the gang.  Brekker, what happened to your tattoo.  Jordie was confused, also concerned.  Just roll with it. Leonus laughs.  You are not getting a tattoo. Jordie hissed in response.   Brekker? Asked a girl.  Um, well I was just getting a drink. Jordie said trying to act like Kaz.  We'll bring one to you, would your guests like some as well or... The girl trailed off.  I'll take one! Leonus chimed in.  You most certainly will not.  Come on.  He's right Leo. Nicole scolded.  She can have one. Jordie nodded and started upstairs, listening to the whispers.  Did Brekker get a girlfriend? One asked.  No he's probably just luring them in before he kills them. Another responded.  Maybe she wants a job?  Maybe he bought her?  Maybe  Maybe  Maybe  Jordie climbed the stairs as fast as possible, leaving people baffled.  Sorry Kaz. Ginger apologized.  We didn't know... Lavender sighed.  It's Ginger's fault... Sage said and stepped out on the way of a kitchen knife that hit the wall next to him.  YOU HAVE A BROTHER? Jesper screamed.  Had. Kaz corrected.  He's still alive Kaz. Sage muttered.  He's in denial, Sage. Wylan said.  Kaz rolled his eyes. I'm headed back to the slat.  The others followed.  When Kaz arrived everyone seemed confused, some even mentioned never seeing him leave.  Kaz shrugged off the strange feeling that some thing was wrong, then chaos ensued.  After a while Jordie and Nicole got fed up with waiting for the real Kaz to arrive and gathered there things to leave. They were interrupted by a knock on the door.  Boss? Aren't you supposed to be at the Van Eck's right now? A boy asked as he handed him another drink.  Jordie thought for a moment before remembering something about the Van Eck manor and where it was. He nodded.  I should get going.  Yeah you-  Jordie was already sprinting for the stairs.  Sir. Your cane!  Jordie jumped on the banister and slid down the staircase, surprising everyone he passed. When he jumped off he landed right on top of someone, Kaz.  As soon as the person hit him Kaz reacted, swinging his cane into their ribs, or arm, or leg, he wasn't actually sure.  Stop, Kaz, wait, STOP! The person screamed, their voice sounded familiar, and everyone was erupting into arguments around them, but Kaz didn't stop.  The person was bleeding now, but Kaz didn't care, they'd jumped on him. You don't jump on Kaz Brekker. His thoughts were interrupted by a shout.  KAZIRMEAR DANGER RIETVELD STOP HITTING JORDAN RIGHT NOW!  Kaz came out of his trance to see Jordie bleeding on the floor and a woman at the top of the stairs.  What did you just call me?  It doesn't matter, I told you to stop and what I say goes. That's when Kaz recognized her, Nicole. Jordie's wife.  Jesper was quick to jump in. Let's all go back to Wylan's, we can finish this, whatever this is, there, ok?  Jordie was the first to nod. Kaz was the first to leave.  Hope you enjoyed it, if you read this please leave a comment about what I can do better.\""

       "\"  kaz was sitting under the tree in the backyard when jordie and jesper came running over. jesper was staying for the weekend and their da was busy, meaning jordie was in charge. normally taking care of kaz was easy, but he and jesper seemed to always see everything as a challenge, which is probably why, jordie assumed, kaz was injured.  hi jordie. kaz said waving at him.  no, not 'hi jordie' your injured. you climbed the tree again, didn't you? jordie asked and shook his head.  yeah, but i didn't know the branch would break. kaz said as jordie inspected him for anything major.  well, your legs and left arm are fine.  my left arm? what about-  your wrist is broken on the right.  kaz's eyes grew wide and jordie realized his mistake. kaz was only seven and the idea of a broken bone seemed terrifying.  hey, but it's alright. i will get a doctor from town and jesper will help you have lunch.  jesper chimed in now. i will?  yes, you will. jordie said through gritted teeth and jesper nodded in agreement, afraid of what might happen if he refused.  after he made sure jesper and kaz were inside and that kaz was in a position that he could eat without hurting his wrist he went into town. the ride didn't take long on horse, nor did finding a doctor, but something was off about his journey. he told himself he was just paranoid as he led the doctor towards home. he looked at the mountains as he road, watching as the clouds passed by, but the clouds weren't moving, the mountains were.  did you see that? he asked in disbelief  see what? the doctor asked.  the mountains, they-they. jordie stopped talking and laughed. mountains don't move!  no they don't. the doctor said looking confused.  jordie howled. mountains don't move, kaz!  jordie panicked as he trampled his little brother.   he cried as he stopped the horse and ran to his little brother, dead.   help him! help him please! he cried as he held his little brother in his arms.  no. the doctor said from behind him.  no? what do you mean no? isn't that your job. jordie whisked his head around only to see jakkob heterozoon, the man that had scammed him out of his money. the man the killed his brother.  don't you see jordie? heterozoon spat as he drew out a knife. this was the plan all along.  jordie woke up crying. it had been seven years since hetrozoon had scammed him and his brother had died. he didn't know why he'd dream't of trampling kaz, most of his dreams were like that though. they were wonderful until kaz died and hetrozoon appeared. nicole looked up from the book she was reading across the room.   dreaming about kaz again? she asked and walked over to the couch.  jordie nodded.  nicole sighed. if anyone was strong enough to survive it was him. you used to always say that. you used to always say you'd find him. what changed?  i tried to find him, but i have to face it, he's gone. even if was alive when they took him he's gone now and it's my fault.  no. they didn't check his pulse, you were scammed. you were trying to get kaz some medicine for his throat. you did nothing wrong.  i got scammed first thing nicole. i told him i was smart, that i'd protect him. i lied.  you did your best.  my best wasn't good enough.  nicole looked at him with sad eyes. he hated her seeing him like this, but his brother seemed to haunt him, like he didn't want to be forgotten.  i hear his voice in my head still. jordie said, a tear sliding down his cheek.  what does he say. nicole asked, trying to help in anyway possible.   things he said when he was alive. 'you burnt the toast. how did you burn the toast?' or, 'the market is the other way, idiot.' jordie laughed. no matter what kaz would always be kaz.  nicole smiled. that sounds like kaz.  yeah, he also tells me to let him talk to leonus by having me the mediator.  oh? and why would he ask about that?  kaz will always be kaz.  that's a reason in itself. they laughed and told stories about their youth when nicole spent time with jordie and kaz spent time with leonus. two families that would never be the same again.   leonus came in around seven with a newspaper. he seemed to happy.  what does it say leo? nicole asked as she turned to her jumpy brother.  jordie was right!  nicole and jordie shared a confused look.  the headline! the headline! leonus chanted.  what's the headline? jordie asked, growing currious.  leonus cleared his throat.  'kaz brekker, the famous bastard of the barrel, dirtyhands, and leader of the dregs, now nod only owns fifth harbor, but fourth and third as well.'   why does that make me right? jordie asked.  how many kaz's do you know? also doesn't the name 'brekker' remind you of the old boating equipment kaz used to take apart to see how it ran?  the realization hit jordie like a bomb.   nicole, leonus, who wants to go on a road trip?  this is a chapter from kaz's pov and it takes place the same time as the last chapter    (see the end of the chapter for  notes.)      kaz had never been tempted to kill wylan before, but if he didn't get away from wylan soon, he might. wylan was lecturing kaz about etiquette and how to eat properly. he was having a guest over the next day and jesper wanted kaz to come. kaz, however, did not want to go. he didn't even know who the guest was. jesper claimed it was a surprise and that he needed to be there, so eventually, kaz agreed.   no! that's your soup spoon! wylan cried out as he watched kaz eat.  a spoon is a spoon wylan. it doesn't matter what it's used for! kaz snapped and continued eating.  alright, alright. i think that's enough for today. jesper sighed.  the dinner is tomorrow jes. wylan groaned.  i know, i know. we'll figure something out. jesper huffed.  just then pim ran in and started talking about a boat delivering rare spices.   there's a boat called the star-half! i saw it myself. it's a fancy boat and it's delivering spices that i almost never see!  kaz nodded. what kind?  nutmeg, rosemary, and danger-root! pim exclaimed.  danger-root? jesper chimed in now.  kaz rolled his eyes. of course jesper would be interested in the danger-root. it tasted amazing and made you forget your worries, but it caused hallucinations of your worst fears. only the bravest of brave dared to eat it. kaz remembered jordie eating some. their dad had a small patch of land where he grew it. jordie was ten at the time and kaz was six. jordie and his friend xander were messing around when xander dared jordie to eat some. at first jordie refused, but after a while of listening to xander calling him a chicken he ate some. jordie never told kaz what he saw, and he stopped talking to xander. xander got fed up with jordie's silence and made a 'peace offering'. he baked cookies and put them on the front porch. kaz was seven now and he thought his dad had made them. unknown to him, there was danger-root in the cookies. he saw everything he loved get destroyed. he watched his family abandon him. he suffered. he hadn't been able to sleep on his own for a month after. he always slept with jordie or his da.   you're not having any. kaz said.  ouch, shut down first thing. jesper said and laughed.  where is this ship? kaz asked, turning his attention back to pim.  fourth harbor.  well, what are we waiting for? jesper asked. it's time for a heist.  the heist was going as planned. wylan and kaz had gotten on board the boat and jesper was sitting on the dock behind some creates, just in case things went wrong. pim stood on the docks, disguised as a worker, waiting for kaz and wylan to deliver the creates. kaz and wylan had already gotten three on the docks and onto another boat of their own. eventually all the nutmeg had been moved and they started on the rosemary when they heard someone coming. they dove behind the creates and sat in silence.   come on, we have to get these kids off the boat before someone catches us.  yeah, and by someone you mean the 'ghost-ship'.  yeah. come on.  kaz peeked over the creates. the 'ghost ship' is what some called the wrath, meaning that these people were slavers. that's when everything went wrong. kaz watched numerous kids get taken away, none that he knew, or at least not until the last few.  the last few were from lij, kids he knew when he was growing up. sage, ginger, and lavender. his old friends, his old classmates.   kaz, they're gone.  i know. keep moving creates, i'll be right back.  where are you going? wylan asked.  sage. kaz replied before following the slavers.  kaz and sage had been great friends. sage was kaz's second best friend, after leonus. sage had looked up to kaz as he was two months older and much more adventurous. although kaz wanted no connections to his past, he couldn't just let an old friend die. he found them in a room, the slavers and sage were having an argument.  sit down! one of the slavers demanded  you're in my spot. sage replied.  excuse me?  you're in my spot. everyone knows that the smartest person in the room belongs in the center.  ginger laughed. then it should be lavender!  sage thought for a second then nodded. yeah, that's true.  kaz smirked. lavender was the second 'best' kid at the school. she was fast enough, smart enough, and brave enough to be, but kaz always won. he was faster, smarter, and braver, or so he had been told. he didn't actually care, sure he had been competitive as a child, but he wasn't a sore loser.   lavender shook her head. no. i'm not smart, otherwise i wouldn't be here.  the only way you wouldn't be here is if you were kaz-smart. sage said and rolled his eyes.  this caught attention of the slavers. kaz-smart?

(see the end of the chapter for  more notes.)     kaz! shouted a man who was clearly drunk.  brekker, i have my report ready. said another.  brekker, who are these people, are they joining the gang.  brekker, what happened to your tattoo.  jordie was confused, also concerned.  just roll with it. leonus laughs.  you are not getting a tattoo. jordie hissed in response.   brekker? asked a girl.  um, well i was just getting a drink. jordie said trying to act like kaz.  we'll bring one to you, would your guests like some as well or... the girl trailed off.  i'll take one! leonus chimed in.  you most certainly will not.  come on.  he's right leo. nicole scolded.  she can have one. jordie nodded and started upstairs, listening to the whispers.  did brekker get a girlfriend? one asked.  no he's probably just luring them in before he kills them. another responded.  maybe she wants a job?  maybe he bought her?  maybe  maybe  maybe  jordie climbed the stairs as fast as possible, leaving people baffled.  sorry kaz. ginger apologized.  we didn't know... lavender sighed.  it's ginger's fault... sage said and stepped out on the way of a kitchen knife that hit the wall next to him.  you have a brother? jesper screamed.  had. kaz corrected.  he's still alive kaz. sage muttered.  he's in denial, sage. wylan said.  kaz rolled his eyes. i'm headed back to the slat.  the others followed.  when kaz arrived everyone seemed confused, some even mentioned never seeing him leave.  kaz shrugged off the strange feeling that some thing was wrong, then chaos ensued.  after a while jordie and nicole got fed up with waiting for the real kaz to arrive and gathered there things to leave. they were interrupted by a knock on the door.  boss? aren't you supposed to be at the van eck's right now? a boy asked as he handed him another drink.  jordie thought for a moment before remembering something about the van eck manor and where it was. he nodded.  i should get going.  yeah you-  jordie was already sprinting for the stairs.  sir. your cane!  jordie jumped on the banister and slid down the staircase, surprising everyone he passed. when he jumped off he landed right on top of someone, kaz.  as soon as the person hit him kaz reacted, swinging his cane into their ribs, or arm, or leg, he wasn't actually sure.  stop, kaz, wait, stop! the person screamed, their voice sounded familiar, and everyone was erupting into arguments around them, but kaz didn't stop.  the person was bleeding now, but kaz didn't care, they'd jumped on him. you don't jump on kaz brekker. his thoughts were interrupted by a shout.  kazirmear danger rietveld stop hitting jordan right now!  kaz came out of his trance to see jordie bleeding on the floor and a woman at the top of the stairs.  what did you just call me?  it doesn't matter, i told you to stop and what i say goes. that's when kaz recognized her, nicole. jordie's wife.  jesper was quick to jump in. let's all go back to wylan's, we can finish this, whatever this is, there, ok?  jordie was the first to nod. kaz was the first to leave.  hope you enjoyed it, if you read this please leave a comment about what i can do better.\""

       "'Matthias can barely hear himself think with the blood pounding in his ears. He\\'d seen the anger in the young boy\\'s eyes, had seen the gun, but somehow, hadn\\'t expected to be shot. He needs to get to Nina. As he tries to navigate the streets of Ketterdam with a bullet wound, he remembers one of the conversations he\\'d first had with... well. His friends. Weeks ago, when they were working on the Ice Court mission. Jesper had made a comment about if they died, that he was going to make Wylan\\'s ghost teach him to play the flute so he could annoy Kaz for eternity. Kaz had said he\\'d just hire Matthias\\'s ghost to kick Jesper\\'s ghost\\'s ass.  Matthias had said his ghost wouldn\\'t associate with Kaz\\'s.  He\\'d felt so strange, making a joking comment with these people, people he thought were the worst kind of people. He\\'d felt like an idiot even saying anything in response. Matthias looks back at the Ice Court mission with a weird combination of bitterness and fondness. He\\'d hated being part of the team, hated being near Nina, hated interacting with Kaz, hated that he was going to be breaking into the Ice Court, the place he\\'d trained at, in his country, with the people he called his family. And somehow, since then... his definition of family has changed.  Matthias\\'s family isn\\'t the druskelle anymore. His family isn\\'t the people who taught him to hate what he didn\\'t understand. His family is the reckless boy who hides his Fabrikator powers, who is an excellent shot, who can make just about anybody laugh.  His family is the small girl who crosses the city using the rooftops more than she uses the streets, who names her weapons after her Saints, who cares so deeply about doing the right thing. His family is the boy who can\\'t read, who willingly allowed himself to be transformed into someone else, who thinks the world can be better than it is. His family is the boy he calls demjin, who pretends he only cares about profit, who hates admitting he has friends but who cares so deeply about them. His family is the Heartrender who destroyed his worldview and helped him rebuild it, who is so confident in herself, who would burn the world down to keep the people she loves safe. His little red bird. Matthias\\'s family is a group of five people who he never thought he would even tolerate. People who make him smile. He doesn\\'t want to leave them. There\\'s so much he wants to, needs to, tell them. So much he wants to see. He wants to see Jesper and Wylan get their shit together. He wants to tell Jesper that he isn\\'t a burden, wants to tell Wylan that he is enough. He wants to see Kaz let his guard down for Inej. He wants to tell Kaz that he\\'s not weak for caring about others, he wants to tell Inej she\\'s the strongest person he knows. He wants to see Nina get excited about waffles a thousand times over again. He wants to tell her she\\'s incredible. He wants to see the five of them happy, free. He wants to tell them he loves them. He wants Jesper\\'s father to be safe, to go back to Novyi Zem and return to his life. He wants Jesper to learn to accept and use his powers, to understand that he is more than his bad habits, because he is and he\\'s the only one who doesn\\'t see it. He wants Inej to go off and save children from a fate like hers, to see the world and find her parents, to be as free as she wants to be. He wants Wylan to hold his head high, to take control of his own life, and ignore what others say about him because his father\\'s voice has been in his head for far too long and he\\'s wrong. He wants Kaz to let some of his barriers fall slightly, to make peace with what was taken from him, whatever that is and however he needs to do it. He wants Nina to learn the extent of her new powers, to return to Ravka and do everything she\\'s ever wanted to do. He wants them to be happy. But more than that, Matthias wants to be there with them. He was wrong when he said his ghost wouldn\\'t associate with theirs. Because here he is, making his way through Ketterdam to Nina, and he doesn\\'t want to leave them. He wants to stay. He wants to return to Fjerda and make some changes, teach the other druskelle about Grisha. But mainly, he wants to stay with his family.  He can\\'t. No matter how much Matthias wants to stay, when Djel calls for somebody, they can\\'t argue. No matter how much he wants to stay alive, stay with his family, he can\\'t. But he can get to Nina. So that\\'s what he\\'ll do.  Wylan\\'s turn  Wylan\\'s in shock. Everything had gone... well, not well. He\\'s starting to wonder how the Dregs ever get anything done if all their plans go wrong. (But maybe it\\'s just his father who\\'d been messing with everything.) But they\\'d adapted. Things went wrong, so they changed the plan and did what they could. And it had worked.  The auction had been a success. Kuwei had been \\'killed\\' by Jesper\\'s miracle shot, Wylan had gotten to see his father arrested, everything was looking good. But Matthias is dead. And none of them know how he died. It\\'s not fair.  \\'We were all supposed to make it,\\' Wylan thinks, not for the first time since it happened. Because somewhere along the way, he\\'d begun thinking they were invincible. They\\'d gotten through everything this far, how could anything beat them? But those were the ideas of a stupid kid.  And Wylan wishes he could go back to being that kid, to believing that people were always kind and the good people always won and... Oh. Do he and the rest of the Crows really count as good? He\\'s not sure. He wants to believe that\\'s the case. He knows Inej has done awful things, has killed many people, but her entire goal in life is to make sure nobody else has to go through what she went through.  And Nina has also done awful things, but she was a soldier. A child soldier. And she\\'s going to try to help the others whose minds have been poisoned. Jesper is impulsive and reckless, but he\\'s always trying to make up for any and all mistakes he\\'s made.  That leaves Wylan and Kaz. And while once upon a time, Wylan would have tried to justify that he was good, he knows he\\'s not. One doesn\\'t create bombs, use acids to melt things down, create something to ruin all the sugar in silos if they\\'re good. One doesn\\'t ruin their father\\'s life if they\\'re good. And Kaz... well. Wylan doesn\\'t know what has happened to Kaz, but he knows the older boy is not considered good by normal standards. If Wylan thinks about it, none of the remaining Crows are good. They all do bad things, constantly, and not always out of necessity.  But by Wylan\\'s standards, they\\'re the best people he knows. And who cares about normal standards? Because Inej is quiet and kind, always notices when one of her friends is upset, even when they think they\\'re hiding it, and goes to talk to them. And she isn\\'t always up for a hug, but that only makes it all the more special to get an Inej hug. And Nina hugs her friends close and claims she will never share food, but when one of her friends is upset, she\\'s passing them a toffee from her stash. And she sings loudly and badly and makes everyone smile. And Jesper is sweet and comforting and is so quick to cheer his friends up. And he makes them laugh and he tosses his arms around their shoulders as if it\\'s nothing and even when he\\'s poking fun at them, he\\'s doing it in a way where he points out their skills and talents.  And Kaz is protective of his friends (because no matter what Kaz may think, Wylan knows Kaz has friends, even if he won\\'t admit it) and would do anything if it meant they\\'d be safe. And when he tells them they did something good, they know he means it.  Plus, not even Dirtyhands himself thought Jan Van Eck would allow his son to be killed. Kaz might have had awful things happen to him, but he is not an awful person because of it. None of them are. But even if Wylan thinks the other four are good people, he knows Matthias is was the best of them. By normal standards, Matthias was a deserter, a traitor. He betrayed his country and his family and became the enemy. But Wylan knows the boy who tried to stop them from seeing the Grisha burned at the stake. He knows the boy who saved Kaz\\'s life, even as he said he should let the other boy die. He knows the boy who loved Nina more than anything, knows the boy who was a quiet source of comfort. Quiet and calm, steady. Wylan knows the boy who would look over at him when Nina or Jesper was flirting with somebody (usually Matthias and Wylan, respectively) and roll his eyes, even when he couldn\\'t hide a smile. He knows the boy who always seemed to know when someone needed someone else to just be there, even if they didn\\'t speak. And now he\\'s gone.  Inej    (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)    Inej can\\'t sleep. Maybe it\\'s the overly comfortable bed in the overwhelmingly lavish room Wylan is letting her use. (He says the room is hers whenever she wants it, but it\\'s a strange thought.) Maybe it\\'s the silence of the streets outside. Maybe it\\'s the fact that they just completed a job. Or maybe it\\'s because of Matthias.  That\\'s probably the most likely reason why she can\\'t sleep. She slips out of bed and crosses to the window, opening it wide to let the cool night air in. And then she perches on the windowsill, letting her feet dangle outside.  It\\'s not safe, she knows that. She knows people would tell her she could fall and die. But then, she\\'s more familiar with the rooftops of Ketterdam than with its streets and alleys.  Besides, odd as it sounds, being on rooftops or windowsills or tightropes has always been able to keep her grounded. It lets her think, make sense of what\\'s going on. And Inej really needs that right now. Because Matthias is gone. She watched him die. And she couldn\\'t do anything. She hadn\\'t expected to care for him at all. The way he acted, the way he treated Nina, not to mention the fact that he was a druskelle, nothing about him made him seem like someone Inej wanted to be around. And then throughout the job... somehow she\\'d learned to see past some of those things. Or at least understand why he was the way he was. His devotion to Djel was something she could respect. His loyalty to his country and his strong morals, although not super helpful to the job, were also admirable. And his love for the family he lost was something she understood all too well.  He had protested when Nina took jurda parem, had cared for her through the withdrawal, had taken every shout and insult she leveled at him unflinchingly. (Maybe he thought he deserved it, she wasn\\'t sure.) And then when she was finally reunited with the rest of the Crows, she could see how different Matthias was from the angry boy she\\'d helped break out of prison. Inej blinks away the tears springing to her eyes.  It\\'s not fair. She trusts the saints with every fiber of her being, but sometimes... sometimes she doesn\\'t understand. She didn\\'t understand when she was taken from her family. She didn\\'t understand when she was forced to work at the Menagerie. She still doesn\\'t understand it. And she definitely doesn\\'t understand why Matthias is gone.  She remembers whispers from family members when someone died. \"Only the good die young.\" Matthias had his flaws, but he was good. While dying, he begged Nina to help the other druskelle, to help them see the error of their ways. He tried his best to help the rest of the Crows whenever he could. But Inej wishes he was still here. But she\\'s trusted her saints this far, she has to trust that they know what they\\'re doing. And Inej will pray that Matthias is with his god. That he is in a better place, even though it\\'s far away. Because she and Matthias both knew there was something beyond this life. And she knows Matthias will find it. She\\'ll miss him. She knows Nina, Wylan, Jesper, and Kaz will too.  They\\'ve created their own family now. A Grisha who can raise the dead, a demo expert who can\\'t read, a sharpshooter with a gambling problem, the ruthless leader of the Dregs, a Wraith who\\'s done awful things, and a soldier who betrayed his country. Matthias will always be one of them.  They\\'ve all changed so much over the course of one job. (One job that went on for too long because Jan Van Eck tried to cross Kaz Brekker.) They\\'re all trying. Kaz seems to think he\\'s trying for Inej, but she hopes he\\'s also trying for himself. That he\\'s trying to take his armor off and let people in because he wants to, not because he feels he has to. (Although Inej doesn\\'t hate the idea that Kaz is doing it for her. She actually quite likes it.) Jesper is trying to be a better person, someone his father can be proud of. Inej knows it\\'s not going to be easy for him, but she\\'ll be there to support him because that\\'s what friends do. And he seems anxious about it, but Inej knows he can do anything if he puts his mind to it. Wylan is trying to be better for himself. He\\'s trying to ask for what he wants, not just needs. (Although he\\'s not great at asking for what he needs, either.) Inej knows he\\'ll have Jesper with him every step of the way, and she knows that Kaz, Nina, and herself will be there, too, even if not always physically present.  Nina is trying to help the other druskelle. And by extension, trying to atone for all she\\'s done. Inej is terrified for her, but Nina is insistent. And Inej admires that. Even if it means it\\'ll be years before she sees Nina again, Inej knows that if anybody could do it, it would be Nina.  And Inej... well. She\\'s going to get a boat and she\\'s going to find her parents. And then, she\\'ll hunt down slavers and everyone responsible for ruining lives the way they ruined hers, and she\\'ll kill them. She\\'s not a good person, that much is clear, but if she can stop even one little girl from going through what she went through... it\\'ll all be worth it. She only wishes Matthias had a chance to continue trying. But he already changed for the better. Just being with Nina managed to change his perspective, change what he believed in.  Inej dries her eyes and steps back inside the room, closing the window and getting back into bed. She\\'ll see him again. They all will. But not for some time. And although she wants to see him soon, she hopes it\\'s not for years to come, that the rest of them may still live and accomplish more, be better than they have been. The saints will take care of the rest.  Not really sure how I feel about this one, but hope you like it anyway!'"

       "'\\n\\nKaz was sitting under the tree in the backyard when Jordie and Jesper came running over. Jesper was staying for the weekend and their Da was busy, meaning Jordie was in charge. Normally taking care of Kaz was easy, but he and Jesper seemed to always see everything as a challenge, which is probably why, Jordie assumed, Kaz was injured.\\n\\n\"Hi Jordie.\" Kaz said waving at him.\\n\\n\"No, not \\'Hi Jordie\\' your injured. You climbed the tree again, didn\\'t you?\" Jordie asked and shook his head.\\n\\n\"Yeah, but I didn\\'t know the branch would break.\" Kaz said as Jordie inspected him for anything major.\\n\\n\"Well, your legs and left arm are fine.\"\\n\\n\"My left arm? What about-\"\\n\\n\"Your wrist is broken on the right.\"\\n\\nKaz\\'s eyes grew wide and Jordie realized his mistake. Kaz was only seven and the idea of a broken bone seemed terrifying.\\n\\n\"Hey, but it\\'s alright. I will get a doctor from town and Jesper will help you have lunch.\"\\n\\nJesper chimed in now. \"I will?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you will.\" Jordie said through gritted teeth and Jesper nodded in agreement, afraid of what might happen if he refused.\\n\\nAfter he made sure Jesper and Kaz were inside and that Kaz was in a position that he could eat without hurting his wrist he went into town. The ride didn\\'t take long on horse, nor did finding a doctor, but something was off about his journey. He told himself he was just paranoid as he led the doctor towards home. He looked at the mountains as he road, watching as the clouds passed by, but the clouds weren\\'t moving, the mountains were.\\n\\n\"Did you see that?\" He asked in disbelief\\n\\n\"See what?\" The doctor asked.\\n\\n\"The mountains, they-they.\" Jordie stopped talking and laughed. \"Mountains don\\'t move!\"\\n\\n\"No they don\\'t.\" The doctor said looking confused.\\n\\nJordie howled. \"Mountains don\\'t move, KAZ!\"\\n\\nJordie panicked as he trampled his little brother. \\n\\nHe cried as he stopped the horse and ran to his little brother, dead. \\n\\n\"Help him! Help him please!\" He cried as he held his little brother in his arms.\\n\\n\"No.\" The doctor said from behind him.\\n\\n\"No? What do you mean no? Isn\\'t that your job.\" Jordie whisked his head around only to see Jakkob Heterozoon, the man that had scammed him out of his money. The man the killed his brother.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you see Jordie?\" Heterozoon spat as he drew out a knife. \"This was the plan all along.\"\\n\\nJordie woke up crying. It had been seven years since Hetrozoon had scammed him and his brother had died. He didn\\'t know why he\\'d dream\\'t of trampling Kaz, most of his dreams were like that though. They were wonderful until Kaz died and Hetrozoon appeared. Nicole looked up from the book she was reading across the room. \\n\\n\"Dreaming about Kaz again?\" She asked and walked over to the couch.\\n\\nJordie nodded.\\n\\nNicole sighed. \"If anyone was strong enough to survive it was him. You used to always say that. You used to always say you\\'d find him. What changed?\"\\n\\n\"I tried to find him, but I have to face it, he\\'s gone. even if was alive when they took him he\\'s gone now and it\\'s my fault.\"\\n\\n\"No. They didn\\'t check his pulse, you were scammed. You were trying to get Kaz some medicine for his throat. You did nothing wrong.\"\\n\\n\"I got scammed first thing Nicole. I told him I was smart, that I\\'d protect him. I lied.\"\\n\\n\"You did your best.\"\\n\\n\"My best wasn\\'t good enough.\"\\n\\nNicole looked at him with sad eyes. He hated her seeing him like this, but his brother seemed to haunt him, like he didn\\'t want to be forgotten.\\n\\n\"I hear his voice in my head still.\" Jordie said, a tear sliding down his cheek.\\n\\n\"What does he say.\" Nicole asked, trying to help in anyway possible. \\n\\n\"Things he said when he was alive. \\'You burnt the toast. How did you burn the toast?\\' or, \\'The market is the other way, idiot.\\'\" Jordie laughed. No matter what Kaz would always be Kaz.\\n\\nNicole smiled. \"That sounds like Kaz.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, he also tells me to let him talk to Leonus by having me the mediator.\"\\n\\n\"Oh? and why would he ask about that?\"\\n\\n\"Kaz will always be Kaz.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a reason in itself.\" They laughed and told stories about their youth when Nicole spent time with Jordie and Kaz spent time with Leonus. Two families that would never be the same again. \\n\\nLeonus came in around seven with a newspaper. He seemed to happy.\\n\\n\"What does it say Leo?\" Nicole asked as she turned to her jumpy brother.\\n\\n\"Jordie was right!\"\\n\\nNicole and Jordie shared a confused look.\\n\\n\"The headline! The headline!\" Leonus chanted.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the headline?\" Jordie asked, growing currious.\\n\\nLeonus cleared his throat. \" \\'Kaz Brekker, the famous Bastard of the Barrel, Dirtyhands, and leader of the Dregs, now nod only owns Fifth Harbor, but Fourth and Third as well.\\' \"\\n\\n\"Why does that make me right?\" Jordie asked.\\n\\n\"How many Kaz\\'s do you know? Also doesn\\'t the name \\'Brekker\\' remind you of the old boating equipment Kaz used to take apart to see how it ran?\"\\n\\nThe realization hit Jordie like a bomb. \\n\\n\"Nicole, Leonus, who wants to go on a road trip?\"\\n\\nThis is a chapter from Kaz\\'s POV and it takes place the same time as the last chapter\\n\\n\\n          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\nKaz had never been tempted to kill Wylan before, but if he didn\\'t get away from Wylan soon, he might. Wylan was lecturing Kaz about etiquette and how to eat properly. He was having a guest over the next day and Jesper wanted Kaz to come. Kaz, however, did not want to go. He didn\\'t even know who the guest was. Jesper claimed it was a surprise and that he needed to be there, so eventually, Kaz agreed. \\n\\n\"No! That\\'s your soup spoon!\" Wylan cried out as he watched Kaz eat.\\n\\n\"A spoon is a spoon Wylan. It doesn\\'t matter what it\\'s used for!\" Kaz snapped and continued eating.\\n\\n\"Alright, alright. I think that\\'s enough for today.\" Jesper sighed.\\n\\n\"The dinner is tomorrow Jes.\" Wylan groaned.\\n\\n\"I know, I know. We\\'ll figure something out.\" Jesper huffed.\\n\\nJust then Pim ran in and started talking about a boat delivering rare spices. \\n\\n\"There\\'s a boat called the Star-half! I saw it myself. It\\'s a fancy boat and it\\'s delivering spices that I almost never see!\"\\n\\nKaz nodded. \"What kind?\"\\n\\n\"Nutmeg, rosemary, and danger-root!\" Pim exclaimed.\\n\\n\"Danger-root?\" Jesper chimed in now.\\n\\nKaz rolled his eyes. Of course Jesper would be interested in the danger-root. It tasted amazing and made you forget your worries, but it caused hallucinations of your worst fears. Only the bravest of brave dared to eat it. Kaz remembered Jordie eating some. Their dad had a small patch of land where he grew it. Jordie was ten at the time and Kaz was six. Jordie and his friend Xander were messing around when Xander dared Jordie to eat some. At first Jordie refused, but after a while of listening to Xander calling him a chicken he ate some. Jordie never told Kaz what he saw, and he stopped talking to Xander. Xander got fed up with Jordie\\'s silence and made a \\'peace offering\\'. He baked cookies and put them on the front porch. Kaz was seven now and he thought his dad had made them. Unknown to him, there was danger-root in the cookies. He saw everything he loved get destroyed. He watched his family abandon him. He suffered. He hadn\\'t been able to sleep on his own for a month after. He always slept with Jordie or his Da. \\n\\n\"You\\'re not having any.\" Kaz said.\\n\\n\"Ouch, shut down first thing.\" Jesper said and laughed.\\n\\n\"Where is this ship?\" Kaz asked, turning his attention back to Pim.\\n\\n\"Fourth harbor.\"\\n\\n\"Well, what are we waiting for?\" Jesper asked. \"It\\'s time for a heist.\"\\n\\nThe heist was going as planned. Wylan and Kaz had gotten on board the boat and Jesper was sitting on the dock behind some creates, just in case things went wrong. Pim stood on the docks, disguised as a worker, waiting for Kaz and Wylan to deliver the creates. Kaz and Wylan had already gotten three on the docks and onto another boat of their own. Eventually all the Nutmeg had been moved and they started on the Rosemary when they heard someone coming. They dove behind the creates and sat in silence. \\n\\n\"Come on, we have to get these kids off the boat before someone catches us.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, and by someone you mean the \\'Ghost-Ship\\'.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah. Come on.\"\\n\\nKaz peeked over the creates. The \\'Ghost Ship\\' is what some called the Wrath, meaning that these people were slavers. That\\'s when everything went wrong. Kaz watched numerous kids get taken away, none that he knew, or at least not until the last few.\\n\\nThe last few were from Lij, kids he knew when he was growing up. Sage, Ginger, and Lavender. His old friends, his old classmates. \\n\\n\"Kaz, they\\'re gone.\"\\n\\n\"I know. Keep moving creates, I\\'ll be right back.\"\\n\\n\"Where are you going?\" Wylan asked.\\n\\n\"Sage.\" Kaz replied before following the slavers.\\n\\nKaz and Sage had been great friends. Sage was Kaz\\'s second best friend, after Leonus. Sage had looked up to Kaz as he was two months older and much more adventurous. Although Kaz wanted no connections to his past, he couldn\\'t just let an old friend die. He found them in a room, the slavers and Sage were having an argument.\\n\\n\"Sit down!\" One of the slavers demanded\\n\\n\"You\\'re in my spot.\" Sage replied.\\n\\n\"Excuse me?\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re in my spot. Everyone knows that the smartest person in the room belongs in the center.\"\\n\\nGinger laughed. \"Then it should be Lavender!\"\\n\\nSage thought for a second then nodded. \"Yeah, that\\'s true.\"\\n\\nKaz smirked. Lavender was the second \\'best\\' kid at the school. She was fast enough, smart enough, and brave enough to be, but Kaz always won. He was faster, smarter, and braver, or so he had been told. He didn\\'t actually care, sure he had been competitive as a child, but he wasn\\'t a sore loser. \\n\\nLavender shook her head. \"No. I\\'m not smart, otherwise I wouldn\\'t be here.\"\\n\\n\"The only way you wouldn\\'t be here is if you were Kaz-smart.\" Sage said and rolled his eyes.\\n\\nThis caught attention of the slavers. \"Kaz-smart?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, an old friend of ours was named Kaz. He was a genius! Everyone says he died of the plague, but there\\'s no way that\\'s true. If anyone survived it was him! He\\'s probably the king of the city now!\" Sage bragged.\\n\\nThe slavers shared nervous glances.\\n\\n\"What?\" Sage asked. \"Kaz and Jordan were here and Kaz was supposed to be dead. Jordan left and was sad, but never stopped looking for Kaz, if anyone survived it was Kaz.\"\\n\\nKaz smirked. Sage knew him so well, it bothered him.\\n\\n\"Does this uh, this Kaz have a last name?\" A slaver asked quietly.\\n\\n\"Uh, I sure hope he does.\"\\n\\n\"What is it?\"\\n\\n\"I said he has a last name,\" Sage said and rolled his eyes, \"not that I\\'d tell you it.\"\\n\\nKaz took that as his cue and attacked the slavers. After taking out two of them Sage, Ginger, and Lavender got the idea. With the help it didn\\'t take long to knock the slavers unconscious.\\n\\nKaz stood over a slaver, looking down at it, he only turned his head when he heard a voice.\\n\\n\"Well, well, well. Look who decided to join the party.\" Sage laughed.\\n\\n\"Someone smart, someone brave, someone daring.\" Ginger teased.\\n\\n\"The one, the only, KAZIRMEAR!\" Lavender hollered. \\n\\n\"Kazirmear?\" An all too familiar voice said.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t even think about calling me that Wylan.\"\\n\\nWylan smirked. \"Hello everyone, I am Wylan. Kazirmear and I were stea- moving spices when he saw you. He didn\\'t give me an explanation why he followed you, he just said,\\'Sage.\\' Does that mean anything to any of you?\"\\n\\nSage smirked. \"Sage Exel at your service!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you\\'re a person. Why did Kazirmear say your name?\"\\n\\nKaz shot Wylan a death glare that only made Wylan smile more.\\n\\n\"Probably \\'cause we were friends when we were kids.\" Sage said and shugged.\\n\\n\"KAZ HAD FRIENDS???\"\\n\\nSage, Ginger, and Lavender, looked hurt.\\n\\n\"Yes! Sage, Ginger, and I were Kaz\\'s friends! He didn\\'t tell you about us?\"\\n\\n\"No, but I can\\'t wait to hear all about it.\" Wylan said and walked away beckoning for the eight children in the room to follow.\\n\\nThey did.\\n\\nKaz asked Wylan about the other kids and was told they were safe and he had people looking for their families. Kaz nodded.\\n\\n\"Sage, Ginger, and Lavender. I can get them home, so don\\'t worry about it.\"\\n\\nWylan raised an eyebrow, but nodded. \\n\\nThen there was a gunshot.\\n\\nI hope you\\'re enjoying this, please feel free to leave comments about my work so that I can see what I need to improve.\\n\\nThis is gonna be... different\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Sage! Sage! Sage! Sage!\" Jesper and Wylan chanted as Sage chugged a bottle of grape juice.\\n\\n\"Done! Lavender what\\'s my time?\" Sage hollered as he slammed the bottle done.\\n\\n\"One minute twenty-three seconds.\" Lavender responded from the counter where she sat.\\n\\n\"Dang it!\" Sage moaned.\\n\\n\"What that\\'s really good.\" Jesper remarked confusedly.\\n\\n\"I still can\\'t beat Kaz\\'s record.\"\\n\\nWylan choked on his drink. \"Kazirmear\\'s record?\"\\n\\nKaz growled at Wylan who laughed in return.\\n\\n\"Yeah! Kaz can drink an entire bottle in thirty-seven seconds!\" Sage bragged.\\n\\n\"He can? I\\'ve never seen him chug anything.\" Jesper pouted.\\n\\n\"Never will.\" Kaz replied.\\n\\n\"Sure he will, if we can get Jordie to compete with you.\" Ginger laughed.\\n\\nKaz growled. \"He\\'s dead, I saw his dead corpse in the-\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s alive! He\\'s livin\\' with his wife and Leonus!\"\\n\\n\"Why would Leonus be there?\"\\n\\n\"He married Nicole.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, that checks out.\"\\n\\n\"Nicole, Leonus, Jordie, who are these people?\" Jesper asked.\\n\\nKaz sent Ginger and Lavender a warning glance, but Sage was already talking when Kaz turned to give him the same warning.\\n\\n\"Leonus is Kazirmear\\'s,\" That name again, \"Best friend. Nicole is Leonus\\'s sister and Jordie- who\\'s real name is Jordan- Is Kaz\\'s br-\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s nobody.\" Kaz interupted.\\n\\n\"Come on Kaz.\" Lavender sighed.\\n\\n\"Yeah you can\\'t cut people out of your life especially not your brother.\" Ginger finished.\\n\\nSilence filled the room and Kaz\\'s old friend\\'s realized their mistake.\\n\\n\"They didn\\'t know?\" Sage asked.\\n\\n\"Sage- No.\"\\n\\nJordie was nervous. It\\'d been years since, the incident, and he was afriad of what he\\'d find. Kaz Brekker was a gang leader, and feared, and cruel. Nothing like his little brother, yet he was. \\n\\n\"What is he tries to hurt you?\" Leonus rambled as they walked the streets of Ketterdam.\\n\\n\"He-he won\\'t.\" Jordie murmured, looking for the Slat, the area where Kaz Brekker lives.\\n\\nThey finally arrived only to find that Jordie and Kaz look insanely alike, causing everyone to believe they\\'re the same person.\\n\\n\"Just roll with it.\" Leonus whispered.\\n\\n\"Um...\"\\n\\nJordie rolls with it, Kaz doesn\\'t\\n\\nThis might suck, sorry if it does. ANywaY HavE FuN!\\n\\n\\n            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Kaz!\" Shouted a man who was clearly drunk.\\n\\n\"Brekker, I have my report ready.\" Said another.\\n\\n\"Brekker, who are these people, are they joining the gang.\"\\n\\n\"Brekker, what happened to your tattoo.\"\\n\\nJordie was confused, also concerned.\\n\\n\"Just roll with it.\" Leonus laughs.\\n\\n\"You are not getting a tattoo.\" Jordie hissed in response. \\n\\n\"Brekker?\" Asked a girl.\\n\\n\"Um, well I was just getting a drink.\" Jordie said trying to act like Kaz.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll bring one to you, would your guests like some as well or...\" The girl trailed off.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll take one!\" Leonus chimed in.\\n\\n\"You most certainly will not.\"\\n\\n\"Come on.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s right Leo.\" Nicole scolded.\\n\\n\"She can have one.\" Jordie nodded and started upstairs, listening to the whispers.\\n\\n\"Did Brekker get a girlfriend?\" One asked.\\n\\n\"No he\\'s probably just luring them in before he kills them.\" Another responded.\\n\\n\"Maybe she wants a job?\"\\n\\n\"Maybe he bought her?\"\\n\\n\"Maybe\"\\n\\n\"Maybe\"\\n\\n\"Maybe\"\\n\\nJordie climbed the stairs as fast as possible, leaving people baffled.\\n\\n\"Sorry Kaz.\" Ginger apologized.\\n\\n\"We didn\\'t know...\" Lavender sighed.\\n\\n\"It\\'s Ginger\\'s fault...\" Sage said and stepped out on the way of a kitchen knife that hit the wall next to him.\\n\\n\"YOU HAVE A BROTHER?\" Jesper screamed.\\n\\n\"Had.\" Kaz corrected.\\n\\n\"He\\'s still alive Kaz.\" Sage muttered.\\n\\n\"He\\'s in denial, Sage.\" Wylan said.\\n\\nKaz rolled his eyes. \"I\\'m headed back to the slat.\"\\n\\nThe others followed.\\n\\nWhen Kaz arrived everyone seemed confused, some even mentioned never seeing him leave.\\n\\nKaz shrugged off the strange feeling that some thing was wrong, then chaos ensued.\\n\\nAfter a while Jordie and Nicole got fed up with waiting for the real Kaz to arrive and gathered there things to leave. They were interrupted by a knock on the door.\\n\\n\"Boss? Aren\\'t you supposed to be at the Van Eck\\'s right now?\" A boy asked as he handed him another drink.\\n\\nJordie thought for a moment before remembering something about the Van Eck manor and where it was. He nodded.\\n\\n\"I should get going.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah you-\"\\n\\nJordie was already sprinting for the stairs.\\n\\n\"Sir. Your cane!\"\\n\\nJordie jumped on the banister and slid down the staircase, surprising everyone he passed. When he jumped off he landed right on top of someone, Kaz.\\n\\nAs soon as the person hit him Kaz reacted, swinging his cane into their ribs, or arm, or leg, he wasn\\'t actually sure.\\n\\n\"Stop, Kaz, wait, STOP!\" The person screamed, their voice sounded familiar, and everyone was erupting into arguments around them, but Kaz didn\\'t stop.\\n\\nThe person was bleeding now, but Kaz didn\\'t care, they\\'d jumped on him. You don\\'t jump on Kaz Brekker. His thoughts were interrupted by a shout.\\n\\n\"KAZIRMEAR DANGER RIETVELD STOP HITTING JORDAN RIGHT NOW!\"\\n\\nKaz came out of his trance to see Jordie bleeding on the floor and a woman at the top of the stairs.\\n\\n\"What did you just call me?\"\\n\\n\"It doesn\\'t matter, I told you to stop and what I say goes.\" That\\'s when Kaz recognized her, Nicole. Jordie\\'s wife.\\n\\nJesper was quick to jump in. \"Let\\'s all go back to Wylan\\'s, we can finish this, whatever this is, there, ok?\"\\n\\nJordie was the first to nod. Kaz was the first to leave.\\n\\nHope you enjoyed it, if you read this please leave a comment about what I can do better.'"

 this is a chapter from kaz's pov and it takes place the same time as the last chapter    (see the end of the chapter for  notes.)      kaz had never been tempted to kill wylan before, but if he didn't get away from wylan soon, he might. wylan was lecturing kaz about etiquette and how to eat properly. he was having a guest over the next day and jesper wanted kaz to come. kaz, however, did not want to go. he didn't even know who the guest was. jesper claimed it was a surprise and that he needed to be there, so eventually, kaz agreed.   no! that's your soup spoon! wylan cried out as he watched kaz eat.  a spoon is a spoon wylan. it doesn't matter what it's used for! kaz snapped and continued eating.  alright, alright. i think that's enough for today. jesper sighed.  the dinner is tomorrow jes. wylan groaned.  i know, i know. we'll figure something out. jesper huffed.  just then pim ran in and started talking about a boat delivering rare spices.   there's a boat called the star-half! i saw it myself. it's a fancy boat and it's delivering spices that i almost never see!  kaz nodded. what kind?  nutmeg, rosemary, and danger-root! pim exclaimed.  danger-root? jesper chimed in now.  kaz rolled his eyes. of course jesper would be interested in the danger-root. it tasted amazing and made you forget your worries, but it caused hallucinations of your worst fears. only the bravest of brave dared to eat it. kaz remembered jordie eating some. their dad had a small patch of land where he grew it. jordie was ten at the time and kaz was six. jordie and his friend xander were messing around when xander dared jordie to eat some. at first jordie refused, but after a while of listening to xander calling him a chicken he ate some. jordie never told kaz what he saw, and he stopped talking to xander. xander got fed up with jordie's silence and made a 'peace offering'. he baked cookies and put them on the front porch. kaz was seven now and he thought his dad had made them. unknown to him, there was danger-root in the cookies. he saw everything he loved get destroyed. he watched his family abandon him. he suffered. he hadn't been able to sleep on his own for a month after. he always slept with jordie or his da.   you're not having any. kaz said.  ouch, shut down first thing. jesper said and laughed.  where is this ship? kaz asked, turning his attention back to pim.  fourth harbor.  well, what are we waiting for? jesper asked. it's time for a heist.  the heist was going as planned. wylan and kaz had gotten on board the boat and jesper was sitting on the dock behind some creates, just in case things went wrong. pim stood on the docks, disguised as a worker, waiting for kaz and wylan to deliver the creates. kaz and wylan had already gotten three on the docks and onto another boat of their own. eventually all the nutmeg had been moved and they started on the rosemary when they heard someone coming. they dove behind the creates and sat in silence.   come on, we have to get these kids off the boat before someone catches us.  yeah, and by someone you mean the 'ghost-ship'.  yeah. come on.  kaz peeked over the creates. the 'ghost ship' is what some called the wrath, meaning that these people were slavers. that's when everything went wrong. kaz watched numerous kids get taken away, none that he knew, or at least not until the last few.  the last few were from lij, kids he knew when he was growing up. sage, ginger, and lavender. his old friends, his old classmates.   kaz, they're gone.  i know. keep moving creates, i'll be right back.  where are you going? wylan asked.  sage. kaz replied before following the slavers.  kaz and sage had been great friends. sage was kaz's second best friend, after leonus. sage had looked up to kaz as he was two months older and much more adventurous. although kaz wanted no connections to his past, he couldn't just let an old friend die. he found them in a room, the slavers and sage were having an argument.  sit down! one of the slavers demanded  you're in my spot. sage replied.  excuse me?  you're in my spot. everyone knows that the smartest person in the room belongs in the center.  ginger laughed. then it should be lavender!  sage thought for a second then nodded. yeah, that's true.  kaz smirked. lavender was the second 'best' kid at the school. she was fast enough, smart enough, and brave enough to be, but kaz always won. he was faster, smarter, and braver, or so he had been told. he didn't actually care, sure he had been competitive as a child, but he wasn't a sore loser.   lavender shook her head. no. i'm not smart, otherwise i wouldn't be here.  the only way you wouldn't be here is if you were kaz-smart. sage said and rolled his eyes.  this caught attention of the slavers. kaz-smart?  yeah, an old friend of ours was named kaz. he was a genius! everyone says he died of the plague, but there's no way that's true. if anyone survived it was him! he's probably the king of the city now! sage bragged.  the slavers shared nervous glances.  what? sage asked. kaz and jordan were here and kaz was supposed to be dead. jordan left and was sad, but never stopped looking for kaz, if anyone survived it was kaz.  kaz smirked. sage knew him so well, it bothered him.  does this uh, this kaz have a last name? a slaver asked quietly.  uh, i sure hope he does.  what is it?  i said he has a last name, sage said and rolled his eyes, not that i'd tell you it.  kaz took that as his cue and attacked the slavers. after taking out two of them sage, ginger, and lavender got the idea. with the help it didn't take long to knock the slavers unconscious.  kaz stood over a slaver, looking down at it, he only turned his head when he heard a voice.  well, well, well. look who decided to join the party. sage laughed.  someone smart, someone brave, someone daring. ginger teased.  the one, the only, kazirmear! lavender hollered.   kazirmear? an all too familiar voice said.  don't even think about calling me that wylan.  wylan smirked. hello everyone, i am wylan. kazirmear and i were stea- moving spices when he saw you. he didn't give me an explanation why he followed you, he just said,'sage.' does that mean anything to any of you?  sage smirked. sage exel at your service!  oh, you're a person. why did kazirmear say your name?  kaz shot wylan a death glare that only made wylan smile more.  probably 'cause we were friends when we were kids. sage said and shugged.  kaz had friends???  sage, ginger, and lavender, looked hurt.  yes! sage, ginger, and i were kaz's friends! he didn't tell you about us?  no, but i can't wait to hear all about it. wylan said and walked away beckoning for the eight children in the room to follow.  they did.  kaz asked wylan about the other kids and was told they were safe and he had people looking for their families. kaz nodded.  sage, ginger, and lavender. i can get them home, so don't worry about it.  wylan raised an eyebrow, but nodded.   then there was a gunshot.  i hope you're enjoying this, please feel free to leave comments about my work so that i can see what i need to improve.  this is gonna be... different sage! sage! sage! sage! jesper and wylan chanted as sage chugged a bottle of grape juice.  done! lavender what's my time? sage hollered as he slammed the bottle done.  one minute twenty-three seconds. lavender responded from the counter where she sat.  dang it! sage moaned.  what that's really good. jesper remarked confusedly.  i still can't beat kaz's record.  wylan choked on his drink. kazirmear's record?  kaz growled at wylan who laughed in return.  yeah! kaz can drink an entire bottle in thirty-seven seconds! sage bragged.  he can? i've never seen him chug anything. jesper pouted.  never will. kaz replied.  sure he will, if we can get jordie to compete with you. ginger laughed.  kaz growled. he's dead, i saw his dead corpse in the-  he's alive! he's livin' with his wife and leonus!  why would leonus be there?  he married nicole.  ah, that checks out.  nicole, leonus, jordie, who are these people? jesper asked.  kaz sent ginger and lavender a warning glance, but sage was already talking when kaz turned to give him the same warning.  leonus is kazirmear's, that name again, best friend. nicole is leonus's sister and jordie- who's real name is jordan- is kaz's br-  he's nobody. kaz interupted.  come on kaz. lavender sighed.  yeah you can't cut people out of your life especially not your brother. ginger finished.  silence filled the room and kaz's old friend's realized their mistake.  they didn't know? sage asked.  sage- no.  jordie was nervous. it'd been years since, the incident, and he was afriad of what he'd find. kaz brekker was a gang leader, and feared, and cruel. nothing like his little brother, yet he was.   what is he tries to hurt you? leonus rambled as they walked the streets of ketterdam.  he-he won't. jordie murmured, looking for the slat, the area where kaz brekker lives.  they finally arrived only to find that jordie and kaz look insanely alike, causing everyone to believe they're the same person.  just roll with it. leonus whispered.  um...  jordie rolls with it, kaz doesn't  this might suck, sorry if it does. anyway have fun!      (see the end of the chapter for  more notes.)     kaz! shouted a man who was clearly drunk.  brekker, i have my report ready. said another.  brekker, who are these people, are they joining the gang.  brekker, what happened to your tattoo.  jordie was confused, also concerned.  just roll with it. leonus laughs.  you are not getting a tattoo. jordie hissed in response.   brekker? asked a girl.  um, well i was just getting a drink. jordie said trying to act like kaz.  we'll bring one to you, would your guests like some as well or... the girl trailed off.  i'll take one! leonus chimed in.  you most certainly will not.  come on.  he's right leo. nicole scolded.  she can have one. jordie nodded and started upstairs, listening to the whispers.  did brekker get a girlfriend? one asked.  no he's probably just luring them in before he kills them. another responded.  maybe she wants a job?  maybe he bought her?  maybe  maybe  maybe  jordie climbed the stairs as fast as possible, leaving people baffled.  sorry kaz. ginger apologized.  we didn't know... lavender sighed.  it's ginger's fault... sage said and stepped out on the way of a kitchen knife that hit the wall next to him.  you have a brother? jesper screamed.  had. kaz corrected.  he's still alive kaz. sage muttered.  he's in denial, sage. wylan said.  kaz rolled his eyes. i'm headed back to the slat.  the others followed.  when kaz arrived everyone seemed confused, some even mentioned never seeing him leave.  kaz shrugged off the strange feeling that some thing was wrong, then chaos ensued.  after a while jordie and nicole got fed up with waiting for the real kaz to arrive and gathered there things to leave. they were interrupted by a knock on the door.  boss? aren't you supposed to be at the van eck's right now? a boy asked as he handed him another drink.  jordie thought for a moment before remembering something about the van eck manor and where it was. he nodded.  i should get going.  yeah you-  jordie was already sprinting for the stairs.  sir. your cane!  jordie jumped on the banister and slid down the staircase, surprising everyone he passed. when he jumped off he landed right on top of someone, kaz.  as soon as the person hit him kaz reacted, swinging his cane into their ribs, or arm, or leg, he wasn't actually sure.  stop, kaz, wait, stop! the person screamed, their voice sounded familiar, and everyone was erupting into arguments around them, but kaz didn't stop.  the person was bleeding now, but kaz didn't care, they'd jumped on him. you don't jump on kaz brekker. his thoughts were interrupted by a shout.  kazirmear danger rietveld stop hitting jordan right now!  kaz came out of his trance to see jordie bleeding on the floor and a woman at the top of the stairs.  what did you just call me?  it doesn't matter, i told you to stop and what i say goes. that's when kaz recognized her, nicole. jordie's wife.  jesper was quick to jump in. let's all go back to wylan's, we can finish this, whatever this is, there, ok?  jordie was the first to nod. kaz was the first to leave.  hope you enjoyed it, if you read this please leave a comment about what i can do better.\""

this was the plan all along  jordie woke up crying it had been seven years since hetrozoon had scammed him and his brother had died he didn't know why he'd dream't of trampling kaz most of his dreams were like that though they were wonderful until kaz died and hetrozoon appeared nicole looked up from the book she was reading across the room   dreaming about kaz again she asked and walked over to the couch  jordie nodded  nicole sighed if anyone was strong enough to survive it was him you used to always say that you used to always say you'd find him what changed  i tried to find him but i have to face it he's gone even if was alive when they took him he's gone now and it's my fault  no they didn't check his pulse you were scammed you were trying to get kaz some medicine for his throat you did nothing wrong  i got scammed first thing nicole i told him i was smart that i'd protect him i lied  you did your best  my best wasn't good enough  nicole looked at him with sad eyes he hated her seeing him like this but his brother seemed to haunt him like he didn't want to be forgotten  i hear his voice in my head still jordie said a tear sliding down his cheek  what does he say nicole asked trying to help in anyway possible   things he said when he was alive 'you burnt the toast how did you burn the toast' or 'the market is the other way idiot' jordie laughed no matter what kaz would always be kaz  nicole smiled that sounds like kaz  yeah he also tells me to let him talk to leonus by having me the mediator  oh and why would he ask about that  kaz will always be kaz  that's a reason in itself they laughed and told stories about their youth when nicole spent time with jordie and kaz spent time with leonus two families that would never be the same again   leonus came in

whisked his head around only to see jakkob heterozoon the man that had scammed him out of his money the man the killed his brother  don't you see jordie heterozoon spat as he drew out a knife this was the plan all along  jordie woke up crying it had been seven years since hetrozoon had scammed him and his brother had died he didn't know why he'd dream't of trampling kaz most of his dreams were like that though they were wonderful until kaz died and hetrozoon appeared nicole looked up from the book she was reading across the room   dreaming about kaz again she asked and walked over to the couch  jordie nodded  nicole sighed if anyone was strong enough to survive it was him you used to always say that you used to always say you'd find him what changed  i tried to find him but i have to face it he gone even if was alive when they took him he gone now and it my fault  no they didn't check his pulse you were scammed you were trying to get kaz some medicine for his throat you did nothing wrong  i got scammed first thing nicole i told him i was smart that i'd protect him i lied  you did your best  my best wasn't good enough  nicole looked at him with sad eyes he hated her seeing him like this but his brother seemed to haunt him like he didn't want to be forgotten  i hear his voice in my head still jordie said a tear sliding down his cheek  what does he say nicole asked trying to help in anyway possible   things he said when he was alive 'you burnt the toast how did you burn the toast' or 'the market is the other way idiot' jordie laughed no matter what kaz would always be kaz  nicole smiled that sounds like kaz  yeah he also tells me to let him talk to leonus by having me the mediator  oh and why would he ask about that  kaz will always be kaz  that a reason in itself they laughed and told stories about their youth when nicole spent time with jordie and kaz spent time with leonus two families that would never be the same again   leonus came in around seven with a newspaper he seemed to happy  what does it say leo nicole asked as she turned to her jumpy brother  jordie was right  nicole and jordie shared a confused look  the headline the headline leonus chanted  what the headline jordie asked growing currious  leonus cleared his throat  'kaz brekker the famous bastard of the barrel dirtyhands and leader of the dregs now nod only owns fifth harbor but fourth and third as well'   why does that make me right jordie asked  how many kaz do you know also doesn't the name 'brekker' remind you of the old boating equipment kaz used to take apart to see how it ran  the realization hit jordie like a bomb   nicole leonus who wants to go on a road trip  this is a chapter from kaz pov and it takes place the same time as the last chapter    (see the end of the chapter for  notes)      kaz had never been tempted to kill wylan before but if he didn't get away from wylan soon he might wylan was lecturing kaz about etiquette and how to eat properly he was having a guest over the next day and jesper wanted kaz to come kaz however did not want to go he didn't even know who the guest was jesper claimed it was a surprise and that he needed to be there so eventually kaz agreed   no that your soup spoon wylan cried out as he watched kaz eat  a spoon is a spoon wylan it doesn't matter what it used for kaz snapped and continued eating  alright alright i think that enough for today jesper sighed  the dinner is tomorrow jes wylan groaned  i know i know we'll figure something out jesper huffed  just then pim ran in and started talking about a boat delivering rare spices   there a boat called the star-half i saw it myself it a fancy boat and it delivering spices that i almost never see  kaz nodded what kind  nutmeg rosemary and danger-root pim exclaimed  danger-root jesper chimed in now  kaz rolled his eyes of course jesper would be interested in the danger-root it tasted amazing and made you forget your worries but it caused hallucinations of your worst fears only the bravest of brave dared to eat it kaz remembered jordie eating some their dad had a small patch of land where he grew it jordie was ten at the time and kaz was six jordie and his friend xander were messing around when xander dared jordie to eat some at first jordie refused but after a while of listening to xander calling him a chicken he ate some jordie never told kaz what he saw and he stopped talking to xander xander got fed up with jordie silence and made a 'peace offering' he baked cookies and put them on the front porch kaz was seven now and he thought his dad had made them unknown to him there was danger-root in the cookies he saw everything he loved get destroyed he watched his family abandon him he suffered he hadn't been able to sleep on his own for a month after he always slept with jordie or his da   you're not having any kaz said  ouch shut down first thing jesper said and laughed  where is this ship kaz asked turning his attention back to pim  fourth harbor  well what are we waiting for jesper asked it time for a heist  the heist was going as planned wylan and kaz had gotten on board the boat and jesper was sitting on the dock behind some creates just in case things went wrong pim stood on the docks disguised as a worker waiting for kaz and wylan to deliver the creates kaz and wylan had already gotten three on the docks and onto another boat of their own eventually all the nutmeg had been moved and they started on the rosemary when they heard someone coming they dove behind the creates and sat in silence   come on we have to get these kids off the boat before someone catches us  yeah and by someone you mean the 'ghost-ship'  yeah come on  kaz peeked over the creates the 'ghost ship' is what some called the wrath meaning that these people were slavers that when everything went wrong kaz watched numerous kids get taken away none that he knew or at least not until the last few  the last few were from lij kids he knew when he was growing up sage ginger and lavender his old friends his old classmates   kaz they're gone  i know keep moving creates i'll be right back  where are you going wylan asked  sage kaz replied before following the slavers  kaz and sage had been great friends sage was kaz second best friend after leonus sage had looked up to kaz as he was two months older and much more adventurous although kaz wanted no connections to his past he couldn't just let an old friend die he found them in a room the slavers and sage were having an argument  sit down one of the slavers demanded  you're in my spot sage replied  excuse me  you're in my spot everyone knows that the smartest person in the room belongs in the center  ginger laughed then it should be lavender  sage thought for a second then nodded yeah that true  kaz smirked lavender was the second 'best' kid at the school she was fast enough smart enough and brave enough to be but kaz always won he was faster smarter and braver or so he had been told he didn't actually care sure he had been competitive as a child but he wasn't a sore loser   lavender shook her head no i'm not smart otherwise i wouldn't be here  the only way you wouldn't be here is if you were kaz-smart sage said and rolled his eyes  this caught attention of the slavers kaz-smart  yeah an old friend of ours was named kaz he was a genius everyone says he died of the plague but there no way that true if anyone survived it was him he probably the king of the city now sage bragged  the slavers shared nervous glances  what sage asked kaz and jordan were here and kaz was supposed to be dead jordan left and was sad but never stopped looking for kaz if anyone survived it was kaz  kaz smirked sage knew him so well it bothered him  does this uh this kaz have a last name a slaver asked quietly  uh i sure hope he does  what is it  i said he has a last name sage said and rolled his eyes not that i'd tell you it  kaz took that as his cue and attacked the slavers after taking out two of them sage ginger and lavender got the idea with the help it didn't take long to knock the slavers unconscious  kaz stood over a slaver looking down at it he only turned his head when he heard a voice  well well well look who decided to join the party sage laughed  someone smart someone brave someone daring ginger teased  the one the only kazirmear lavender hollered   kazirmear an all too familiar voice said  don't even think about calling me that wylan  wylan smirked hello everyone i am wylan kazirmear and i were stea- moving spices when he saw you he didn't give me an explanation why he followed you he just saidage' does that mean anything to any of you  sage smirked sage exel at your service  oh you're a person why did kazirmear say your name  kaz shot wylan a death glare that only made wylan smile more  probably 'cause we were friends when we were kids sage said and shugged  kaz had friends  sage ginger and lavender looked hurt  yes sage ginger and i were kaz friends he didn't tell you about us  no but i can't wait to hear all about it wylan said and walked away beckoning for the eight children in the room to follow  they did  kaz asked wylan about the other kids and was told they were safe and he had people looking for their families kaz nodded  sage ginger and lavender i can get them home so don't worry about it  wylan raised an eyebrow but nodded   then there was a gunshot  i hope you're enjoying this please feel free to leave comments about my work so that i can see what i need to improve  this is gonna be different sage sage sage sage jesper and wylan chanted as sage chugged a bottle of grape juice  done lavender what my time sage hollered as he slammed the bottle done  one minute twenty-three seconds lavender responded from the counter where she sat  dang it sage moaned  what that really good jesper remarked confusedly  i still can't beat kaz record  wylan choked on his drink kazirmear record  kaz growled at wylan who laughed in return  yeah kaz can drink an entire bottle in thirty-seven seconds sage bragged  he can i've never seen him chug anything jesper pouted  never will kaz replied  sure he will if we can get jordie to compete with you ginger laughed  kaz growled he dead i saw his dead corpse in the-  he alive he livin' with his wife and leonus  why would leonus be there  he married nicole  ah that checks out  nicole leonus jordie who are these people jesper asked  kaz sent ginger and lavender a warning glance but sage was already talking when kaz turned to give him the same warning  leonus is kazirmear that name again best friend nicole is leonus sister and jordie- who real name is jordan- is kaz br-  he nobody kaz interupted  come on kaz lavender sighed  yeah you can't cut people out of your life especially not your brother ginger finished  silence filled the room and kaz old friend realized their mistake  they didn't know sage asked  sage- no  jordie was nervous it'd been years since the incident and he was afriad of what he'd find kaz brekker was a gang leader and feared and cruel nothing like his little brother yet he was   what is he tries to hurt you leonus rambled as they walked the streets of ketterdam  he-he won't jordie murmured looking for the slat the area where kaz brekker lives  they finally arrived only to find that jordie and kaz look insanely alike causing everyone to believe they're the same person  just roll with it leonus whispered  um  jordie rolls with it kaz doesn't  this might suck sorry if it does anyway have fun      (see the end of the chapter for  more notes)     kaz shouted a man who was clearly drunk  brekker i have my report ready said another  brekker who are these people are they joining the gang  brekker what happened to your tattoo  jordie was confused also concerned  just roll with it leonus laughs  you are not getting a tattoo jordie hissed in response   brekker asked a girl  um well i was just getting a drink jordie

nicole scolded  she can have one jordie nodded and started upstairs listening to the whispers  did brekker get a girlfriend one asked  no he probably just luring them in before he kills them another responded  maybe she wants a job  maybe he bought her  maybe  maybe  maybe  jordie climbed the stairs as fast as possible leaving people baffled  sorry kaz ginger apologized  we didn't know lavender

he in denial sage wylan said  kaz rolled his eyes i'm headed back to the slat  the others followed  when kaz arrived everyone seemed confused some even mentioned never seeing him leave  kaz shrugged off the strange feeling that some thing was wrong then chaos ensued  after a while jordie and nicole got fed up with waiting for the real kaz to arrive and gathered there things to leave they were interrupted by a knock on the door  boss aren't you supposed to be at the van eck right now a boy asked as he handed him another drink  jordie thought for a moment before remembering something about
